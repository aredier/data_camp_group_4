lots of great features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone works well, fast and haven't had any trouble with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am really enjoying the phone so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very easy to use and the camera is great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ought black friday at great price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had to fight the crowds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a phone is a phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing special.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve been needing a new phone for awhile and was happy to take advantage of the great sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone so far.. no real issues hopefully none show up,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a change from the apple iphone but it has great qualities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very slim nice body and great touch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's only been a week, but it's been fun getting to know my new phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"coming from a s4 that was over 4-years-old but still running great, there wasn't much adjustment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everything is just a little shinier, a little faster, a little newer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the screen looks so much smaller when you first pick it up, but as soon as it comes on...oh, man, beautiful and shiny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"liking the camera, but i don't necessarily understand the need for the snapchat-like stickers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are entertaining for the first 30 minutes, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pro mode is fun to mess around with if you understand that kind of stuff, but auto mode is very easy to work with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do worry about protecting this baby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've got an otterbox case on her right now, but they haven't figured out the built in screen protectors yet, so i've got an amazon find on order for some of the more rough and tumble activities i find myself in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my friend's week old s8 has already found a pointy surface that cracked the corner of the gorgeous, curved screen, through a seperate, stick on screen protector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"besides that, i've been impressed so far, but let's see if i can make this one last 4 years, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has more memory and i don't have to charge it ten times a day anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's ok but it's not much different from the samsung 6 that i had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the camera is ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the way this phone works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great design easy to hold,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall i like this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a huge upgrade from my galaxy s3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't sure i'd like the curved edge but i've gotten used to it pretty quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only draw back i've seen is the battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it isn't horrible but i think it could be better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone i'm happy with this phone i love this screen,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new samsung galaxy 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great pictures, never any problems with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems to be quick and responsive with no freezing up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is an overall great phone for anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you love android you will love this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
baught this phone for my mother and it has noy let us down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love the color, very easy to use, overall a great phone to get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's basically the s6 with a better screen but it is pretty much the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bells and whistles just don't interest me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we bought 5 of these for the “family” christmas gift.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however of course mommy and daddy had to try them out first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking about buying cheaper ones but i am so glad i didn’t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this work great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
android phone top of line and samsung galaxy is the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our son switched from apple to samsung and is thrilled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
paired with vr was a big hit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent choice for anyone wishing to upgrade their mobile phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone who already uses an android will like the features exclusive to samsung and any exiting samsung user will like the new camera and specs on the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
super satisfied!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really able to move around and find different things in my phone but this one i can really find my way around,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"staff was great to work with at the bestbuy store in altamonte, fl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this phone is fancy, for me, anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the camera is great, the battery lasts and it is quick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i am not impressed by is the texting/keyboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe it has to do with the curved screen, but it can be difficult to text quickly or accurately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
phones are always better than the last one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is one of those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s good so buy it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
switched from iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the customization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
struggling with the placement of letters on keyboard and video quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other than that very pleased.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great option if you are bored with iphone,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my mom likes android phones and i got her the newest android phone on the market but she wasn’t happy that the wi-fi calling doesn’t work all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where she lives there is no cell towers so she relies on the wi-fi in the house to connect phone too the outside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had this phone for about a month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far it is a little blotchy but had some upgraded features when compared to the s7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is lighter and the screen resolution is much better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
orher wise it's pretty much the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love it...........................................,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use to only buy iphones but will not go back to apple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very easy to move through screens and apps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is amazing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone is a lot more advanced than i anticipated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
water proof works awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went snorkeling and took my phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the features on this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera along is worthy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fit perfectly in either my small or big purse,!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
truly this is more than just a phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had an iphone in the past but switched over to the good old flip phone a while back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i never thought id try another smart phone besides the iphone, but i must say samsung has done quite well with this phone i am happy to say that i am now an android user.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the new features and sound quality!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice phone and features, good pictures, manageable size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
would highly recommend this for everyone of all ages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone has exceeded expectations...coming from an old lg g3 that was on its last leg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no issues had for over a month so far- great camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it for my fiancée's birthday and she loves it, feels great in the hand and has amazing battery life",,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded my husband line to the galaxy s8 from the s7 & he loves this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he admires the vast features, such as the camera, size of screen, slicker look, faster charge and the 256gb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was priced just right & glad we had the opportunity to take advantage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
end it has everything you want to head and it work properly and like the colors and the sound and the ringtone how outlets hey siri use easy to hold basically i like everything about it and then she earned a hold on my hand and i don't break his many cases and it doesn't slide around on my consul,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so many great features and plenty of memory, i always love samsung products!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"easy to use, fast, and it looks great also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
lots of download capacity for all the music i love and videos i take.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
picture quality is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i watch a lot of netflix on my phone and the video quality is outstanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had my phone for a while now and i'm very happy with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery last long and i really like the camera and the screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have had samsung for a few generations now, and just switched to sprint after being with at&t for over 10 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really like this phone, no delays in going from apps, pictures, and videos are sharp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"took me 10 days to figure out how to pair it to my smart watch, a 1st gen moto 360, but it works great now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the curved glass has taken me awhile to get use to, but all in all, i'm glad i stuck with samsung, this phone is a beast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can charge in just a little over an hour, lasts all day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm really enjoying listening to pandora in my truck on my drive to work everyday, thanks to this new phone and unlimited data from sprint.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
all my medical apps work great too at work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall a good phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend this phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from the s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall phone is bigger and faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i don't like some features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the memory card and sim are in a hard to open tray.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has to be put in carefully.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i needed a new sim card the same day i bought the phone, and i blame the tray scratching it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rounded edges on the screen are good and bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it looks nice, but makes sliding left or right a pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
scratch resistant does not mean scratch proof.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
less than 2 weeks in and there's a small scratch mid screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly from a keychain in the same pocket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a weak signal with my old phone at work, this phone is no better (perhaps worse).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
but when i am connected it's a lot smoother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far my s8 is a gem of a phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the photos are wonderful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love the new galaxy 8, a nice upgrade from my galaxy 6",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still learning all its capabilities but what i've used it for so far has been a wonderful experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from an s4 so i can really appreciate the new technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it feels fragile in my hand (it probably isn't really) but i'm looking for a good case and screen protector to help protect my investment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would definitely recommend anyone looking for a new phone to check out the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, had a wonderful purchase experience at best buy in getting my phone operational and explaining the basics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy customer here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great screen and amazing camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got this for my dad on sale and he absolutely loves it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone great clarity on the screen,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm glad i updated to this phone, the camera is far superior to my previous phone and it does everything i need and more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the phone and cheap affordable plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i purchased the samsung - galaxy s8 64gb for my teenage daughter and she loves it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is perfect!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend it to everyone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrade from a note 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is a little blurry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but other then that it fast and responsive,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had an iphone for a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
made a change to samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far quite happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it streams shows easily to my smart tv.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the functions from the user friendly iphone are different but pleased so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no complaints for switching from an iphone yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting acquainted with the device has taken longer than expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the samsung - galaxy s8 64gb - orchid gray (sprint) has a professional look, and several new features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the price of this phone is ridiculous and the car charger from my previous samsung s5 does not work with this phone without the clumsy and frustrating adapter that is included with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they want you to buy another charger specifically for this model which is yet another expense and annoying, especially for loyal samsung customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the price this phone should last at least 5 years!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good phone, great camera, but get a case right away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i t is extremely slippery and very easy to drop,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love my galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love all the features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to navigate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was worried about the battery draining fast but it last all day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it looks nice, is easy to use, and the camera is amazing compared to my old galaxy s6!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
best phone i have ever owned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine needed replacing, after getting this one set up it didn’t take me long to know i was going to like having this phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
great color choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quailty of the cell is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
takes sharp photos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery lasts a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the new bells and whistles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i could do without bixby,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone performs well and i needed more capacity then i had on my s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was disappointed that several features that were on my s5 didn't exist on the s8 (e.g., air view).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall, though, it's a pretty good phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best phone i have owned to date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the quality of pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
being a grandparent it is important to me to capture those special moments with our grand children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beautiful screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes very nice pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to navigate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i needed an awesome phone for my wife.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"she is very happy, i'm happy, and our wallets are happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
paid cash for my 8+ and basically got this one free with at&t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"been using apple iphone for three years and decided to try the galaxy, absolutely love it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure if i’ll ever go back to apple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indoor pics are awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even in poor light.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my old phone galaxy s5 took poor indoor pics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still trying to learn all the features on the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am able to get a phone signal in areas i could not before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"easier to hold, as is slimmer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone that is compact yet has a large screen with great clarity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast processor that does not lag when multi tasking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great camera with professional effects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen clarity is unmatched by other phones on the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only down side is that the bixby button takes getting used to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can be easy to hit with intending to change the volume setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not a feature i use and would be nice if this button could be re-purposed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i upgraded to an s8 from an s5, so this was a huge upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"better screen, better battery, smoother operations, better camera, more camera features, edge controls, better sound on calls, etc, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrades over an s5 are too numerous to go into.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the feel of the phone is great also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it's longer, but it's so thin and rounded edges just make it comfortable to hold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall, a great phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you get one, you won't be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the samsung s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would buy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely love this upgrade over my old android.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely worth it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"camera quality is great, battery life is good and it has everything i need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely worth the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very quick processing and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quick activation process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not a tech person and never really cared too much about the hype around new phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the samsung galaxy 8 is a total exception.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just wish i wouldn't have chosen the virgin mobile prepaid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right after i bought they announced they are dropping android phone for iphone only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been an lg user for years and decided to try the samsung after reading the reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"although there a few lg perks i miss, this phone is pretty amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"feels great in the hand, perfect for one handed operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"activation... well, enter your phone # and it does the rest, can't get any easier than that, sign in to your google account... info from last phone transfers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"display is bright and clear, camera takes crystal clear pics, video quality is super sharp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the iris scanner to unlock your phone is super fast and my favorite of all the unlock options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung browser is very fast and i've been using it over chrome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plenty of memory and you have the option to uninstall some of the pre-installed apps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"handles the live stream stocks app wonderfully, it's like a laptop in your hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from a galaxy s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is so much better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my s6 was starting to slow down...probably because the hardware was too old for the software updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i wanted to upgrade and best buy was selling it for 50.00 cheaper than boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with me elite plus, it was sent to me in 2 days for free.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have zero issue with it and there are million new features...most of which i will probably never use (i am talking to you bixby).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm loving this phone, still learning though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's getting easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i finally treated myself to a new phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't go wrong with the s8 upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, i've had my boost service since nextel having great service and the best buy employees are wonderful especially denise and cheyenne.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sleek, slim, and works as a personal concierge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall i like the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am disappointed with the size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the standard s8 is extremely small compared to the s8 plus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the features make up for the adjustment in size from the s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best samsung galaxy phone to date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
speed is amazing programs run smoothly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64 gig bites of storage plus an external capability storage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera takes great pictures in the light and in the dark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the regular s8 is perfect size even for large hands like myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have nothing but great things to say about this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly recommend this phone to anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung has made it to where you can delete bloat ware programs you really don't care for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my galaxy 5 finally went on the fritz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't like what i was missing in the 6 so i waited until my 5 would no longer work anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is a wonderful upgrade from my s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the camera is amazing, the memory, the sd card option, and the transfer from my s5 to s8 was seamless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just plugged the two phones together with the enclosed adapter and all of my contacts, apps, pictures, text messages, and everything transferred to my s8 easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been using iphone for over 7 years and decided to switch to android.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"old phone started to give out on me, so got this one to replace it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, so good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since it is the newer model, i'm hoping i don't have to replace it for a few years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is very easy to use and takes great pictures,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"samsung is an iphone clone indeed, but done much better via android os.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded my mom from an s7 to the s8 and wow it’s such an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the new design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it comes with so many different features, including emojis and filters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to mention the camera is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also has face recognition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"clear screen, lots of memory and easy to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
personal assistant bixby is easy to use and has a pleasant female voice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my sim card from galaxy s4 wouldn't fit in the new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went to verizon and they installed a new sim for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i am an apply user but this phone is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i do not like is the still buggy android operating system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one day they will fix it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is flawless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'ts my first phone and i'm quite happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the size is not small and it's not large like caring around a tablet in your pocket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far so good i'm still learning all the amazing features it offers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend this phone to anyone who likes average size and awesome quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone has a nice feel to it looks great with it's glass curved screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a very professional looking device.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i choose to buy a sup-case for the back and a tempered glass screen protector for the front, it doesn't tale away the great job samsung did on the amazing looking design of the phone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
being new to the smart phone word i'm very pleased with the camera.it takes sharp clean photos and video!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way to go samsung!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a bit pricey but if you save and be patient you will be happy with a well made device!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% don't regret getting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced an old samsung galaxy s4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also it's very sensitive and opens various programs or text messages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall i like the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love my samsung s8 it's easy to use and takes great pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like the curved sides makes the screen seem larger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
used to have an iphone and wanted to try something new.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"read about some drawbacks about battery life some had experienced, but i haven’t seen any of these issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone charges super fast too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far i’m happy with the switch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from an s3 and this phone is well worth every penny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like the color.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is fantastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is by far the best phone i have ever had!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend it to everyone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
switched from iphone to new samsung s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone has exceeded expectations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is like a powerful computer for your pocket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just upgraded from the s6 and it is familiar enough, but with so many great new features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the curved screen makes it nearly impossible to get a good screen protector on, but other than that, it's great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can text easily to my friends and take pictures anytime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like android much better than apple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy was very patient when i was making up my mind about which carrier to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they offered good information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone easy to operate takes great pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like the curved screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my samsung s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had plenty oh phones.. iphones and androids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this s8 is hands down my favorite!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the quality of my new samsung - galaxy s8 64gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like the coral blue color of this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone is reliable and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes good pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery life is at least ten hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i rarely have any problems with this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm very happy with my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best phone i've ever had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after switching from htc, it was a great improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
great battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is actually better than advertised that sure doesn't happen very often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"crystal clear display, great sound and fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought 2 of the samsung s8 phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're nice upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast sleek awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now wish i had waited for note 8,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a great phone i don’t know how i ever lived with out it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the galaxy s8 is a good phone, but freezes and have to reset phone too often",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from a galaxy s4 mini.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tend towards smaller phones - i went with this because of the half-priced deal during cyber monday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am very happy with the functionality and performance of the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have big hands and can use the finger scanner fairly successfully - my girlfriend has issues from time to time with the fingerprint and one-hand using this phone because she has small hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's a bit too tall for comfort inside of a guy's pocket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless i position the phone accordingly, it pushes into my hip when i sit down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aside from the size of the phone, i really enjoy it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not an excessive user and do not use social media (or most of the other advanced features) on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i charge the phone every 3 days (i put the phone in medium power saving mode) - my work iphone 6s gets the same usage and i charge this every 1.5 days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is fast enough if i need to research something on the internet, switch apps, load the camera or navigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all in all, awesome product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wish it was an inch shorter in height.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have had this phone for under a month, so far no problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a samsung s 6 before, i am happy with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought this s8 for my son and he absolutely loves it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
says this is a major upgrade from his s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i switched from a long time htc loyal customer to the samsung galaxy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i have to say im impressed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery lasts a long time!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the phone is overall a good user friendly product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i decided to make the switch to this phone from my iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a good decision, but it’s taking some getting used to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the size of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
smaller than the last one i had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and actually, even though it's smaller, the screen is much bigger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't need my reading glasses to see my screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my only regret is that i couldn't way to the new one came out so i am constantly updating my phone already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
replaced my galaxy s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only had phone for a month, so i'm still playing with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the thin profile and full screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love the phone great size , appearance of phone & easy to use",,,,,,,,,,,,,
an excellent product great camera the security is good apps great,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung keeps improving on their phones this one is light excellent camera slim and has excellent security features,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung 8 is the best phone on the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was leery of getting an upgrade after hearing lots of things about some of the new phones, but i love my new phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s so easy to navigate and the camera is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery lasts so much longer too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes my fingerprint unlock easily which was a problem on my old phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love samsung glad to have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery charges very quickly and last,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so many features !,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung’s technology amazes me everyday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone big improvement over my galaxy s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another great samsung product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was a long needed upgrade and i'm totally happy with it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great pictures and easy phone to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried switching from an iphone to an android, and this is the device i used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i lasted a week before taking it back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there were some features that i really liked about this phone, but they weren’t enough to outweigh my frustrations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps if i had started my smart phone journey with a droid i would have loved this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and perhaps i was a bit jaded by the horrible screen protector i ended up with, but i have since gone back to an iphone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of the things i liked were that the screen was the whole front of the device.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fact that certain apps came preloaded was actually nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also like the functionality of some of the phone’s features as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however, the screen protector was a piece of junk (as stated in another review).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and, i have since realized that the curved screen might not be such a good idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it does look cool and allows for additional options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however, it is also harder to protect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"coming from a clumsy person, this is a huge deal breaker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don’t want to live paranoid of dropping my phone and having the screen protector crack, or worse because the protector fell off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, coming from an iphone, the functional differences between the two are bigger than i think they should be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for one, i was almost late getting up for work because my alarm didn’t go off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
my iphone allows alarms to work despite do not disturb being on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would i guess i had to change a setting on the droid to allow that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
come on designers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some cooperation between brands would be nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all of us want to be so product loyal because we are forced to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also love the new (apple) wireless charging capability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i’m a bit annoyed that the technology has been out there for years, but apple has finally gotten on the bandwagon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no reason for exclusivity like that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’m going to say that i wouldn’t recommend this product because i have gone back to an iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are already a droid user, you may love this upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice screen and nice camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the same time it still is small enough to carry everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a great phone i bought it for my wife and she loves it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far so good, like all the features and usability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guys at best buy are so helpful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they know their stuff too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
collen went to lunch an hour late because he wasn't finished helping me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then collen helped me over the phone the next day so that i wouldn't have to drive 86 miles from susanville to reno.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the samsung galaxy s8 was the first smartphone that i have owned, so i don't have much to compare it to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i have been using the phone for about 2 months now and i am very happy with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i preferred the s8 to the s8+ and the note 8 because it is smaller (and cheaper) than both of those models and i don't really like a large phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you prefer a larger phone, either of those models might suit you better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
but so far i have no complaints about the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i switched from iphone 6s and couldn't be more happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the design is beautiful, got used to the finger scanner very fast and like the place they put it in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can easily set up the phone the way i like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera makes beautiful pictures and the battery holds very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no more looking back, samsung galaxy s8 is a great device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone does it all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has all the features one needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's fast and easy to use with great color oled screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera takes beautiful pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very satisfied with my purchase at best buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought this for my wife for a christmas present, as an upgrade to her galaxy s5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the s7, and this is another great samsung phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is the 4th galaxy product that i have owned, and i am hooked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very easy to use, very dependable, and great quality phones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not too sure about the bixby button, but my wife can just ignore that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep the great phones coming, samsung!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
infinity screen check fast processor check easy on fingers somewhat amazing camera you know it you wont be disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
took a while to get used to the things that were different from our s4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we actually had to go to best buy several times to get someone to show us where and how to do things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but, after playing with it for a few days, we are not enjoying all the updates we are getting over our old phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"upgraded from an s5 to the s8, what a difference!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"did not plan on buying a new phone but my lg g4 only 2 yrs old, died.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"researched galaxy s8, pixel 2 and iphone 7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on best buy promotions, i went with the galaxy s8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sound clarity is very good, good camera, has headphone jack and akg earbuds are included with the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen is bright and clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is very good which was important to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"although i've always had androids, still a bit of a learning curve to learn all of the s8's capabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, very dependable and i am pleased with my choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
just hope that it lives longer than my lg g4 did because the price of all phones is ridiculous .. imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the buying process was easy and safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend buying from best buy before going to carriers stores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect phone for my needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no issues with verizon service, as opposed to the previous carrier i had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought this for my wife as a big upgrade from the s3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"phone is very user friendly for someone that normally uses her phone for facebook, emails and messaging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is awesome and battery lasts all day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did not go into best buy to buy a phone.i was looking for another product that you were out of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i walk past the phone display on my way out and a gentleman named daniel came up to me and asked me if he could help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was curious about the new phone a galaxy s8, and is started asking him questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i told him i was not looking for a phone and he said that’s ok i’ll help you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i asked him several questions, he very patiently answer them for me and i happened to notice a sign that said that there was a big discount if you bought the phone from best buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i told him i would think about it i left and i came back the next day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reason why i came back was because daniel was so nice to me .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he was very patient he was very knowledgeable he was friendly he knew his product and acted like i was the most important person in the store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is why i bought the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
daniel is a huge asset to your knoxville tennessee store and i hope you gets the recognition that he deserves for this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now on the other hand, the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is ok, but i do not love the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i should have tried the camera more when i was in the store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was able to go to a concert exactly two weeks after i bought the phone the pictures are horrendous!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i miss my galaxy s7 so much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately it was past the 14 day return period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i am now stuck with the phone that i really don’t like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fortunately i still have my s7 and i am seriously considering going back to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then there is the problem with the video chat i think it’s called?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can get every single person who has video chat on their phone to work except for my son.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on my end the camera does not light up at all for me to even use it for him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and on his end it shows up that i cannot receive video chat calls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately no one can fix it no one knows why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tech-support blames my sons phone which is with at&t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my son and i went to at&t and their tech-support blames my phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not happy with this situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both of us can video chat with other people on our respective phones but not with each other i would be a lot happier if that problem were fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the price of that phone i thought the camera would be so great ~~ extremely disappointed in the camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also extremely disappointed that i can’t talk to my son face-to-face we video chat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wish i never would’ve bought the phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,
couldn't be any happier with my purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the galaxy 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
won’t go back to an iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast and more bang for your dollar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my biggest complaint about the phone is the text to speech it will only work when the data is on or wi fi on my old samsung it would work any time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because i use this function so much i would have probly went with a 7 had i known this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone who loves android would love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’m an iphone person but my husband loves this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't usually purchase the most popular items, but i backed myself into this samsung phone and i've been really really pleased with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is great and has the best camera ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im not tech savy but i figured this phone out rather quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 came with necessary adaptors to easily transfer from my previous s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plugged the two phones together and everything copied automatically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also includes a microusb to type c adaptor so you can use your old cables to charge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is responsive, excellent screen, upgradeable memory and worthy upgrade from earlier samsung phones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so glad we upgraded from the s7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i prefer samsung products over the over priced ""fruit"" brand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the feel and slimness of the phone even with a cover (otterbox slim) it still feels sleek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real easy to set up and use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you must go out to the website to get the manual, but it is very clear and easy to follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've been a loyal samsung s customer for years so i immediately purchased this phone during the black friday sale, lowest price i saw so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the battery lasts much longer than the s6 edge, the index finger security option is very convenient for on the go, and i love the orchid gray color!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will continue to be a samsung phone customer for years to come!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love my new galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my first smart phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"learn something new
about every day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as a longtime samsung customer, it was an easy choice to upgrade to the s8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the graphics are a step up from my s5 but it is the better battery and bigger storage that really make the difference in my day to day thusfar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the best phones i have had so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is not as good as others like pixel,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we previously owned a pair of j7's and these appear to be faster with a slightly better screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only negative i have found is that the speech recognition doesn't work as well as it used to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great for pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just wish samsung didn’t have all the bloat ware with apps i won’t use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i love that the edges are rounded and that the screen uses up most, if not all, of the screen space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have used iphones and samsung’s before, and i chose samsung as my work phone simply because it is the best equipped phone on the market right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am very happy with my choice - although i would choose the larger screen next time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great price for the latest top line samsung phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
provides good android functionality with the most commonly used apps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
light and easy to hold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
downsides: battery life is deficient with even moderate use; phone has trouble syncing with fitbit wearable tech - a problem fitbit tech support has not yet fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to learn and customize.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another great samsung product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the galaxy s8 is a great phone with much improved battery life and vastly increased internal memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it works a lot like other galaxys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the speech feature still needs work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0ne word of advice: do not establish facial recognition as a security measure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't work in dark conditions and can be a problem at other times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instead, establish a pin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
verizon put through a software update that rendered the facial recognition unusable and effectively locked me out of my screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took hours on the phone to get this fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, best advice is to not do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung is a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced the samsung s6 i had with this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went back to samsung 2 1/2 years ago because i didn't like the way the iphone system works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good battery and best phone i have,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love this phone, it is fast, slim, full of options, and was a breeze to set up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded my samsung galaxy to this model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is very easy to use and didn't need to spend a lot of time learning specifics of the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
takes great photos,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like the new galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has mice features not available on our old s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is awesome and the features are great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i'm so-so on is how the screen curves and i have a little more trouble texting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i really enjoy this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice apps like samsung pay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only negatives are the bixby search engine doesn't match up to google's and the finger recognition is finicky and unreliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
otherwise an all around great phone that fits beautifully in the hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"takes some getting used to (switched from a different brand), but i do love the sleek design, the features and it's fast processor",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has been a couple of weeks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far i love the phone and its many uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love android phones and this phone is the best one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great camera and love the screen size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s8 is a must have phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fast, sleek and works great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pros- pics are great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
free ringtones & apps are great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall features are amazing...
cons- texting is not user friendly as the iphone... finding how to do the simplest things, like capturing a screen shot, is a huge pain... use is not intuitive, as an iphone tends to be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great upgrade, not too big so it still fits in my hand and my purse nicely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
still exploring the features!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it’s a very nice phone 
fast, looks nice , and easy to use",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’m a samsung guy so for me it’s a perfect cell i love my cell,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone is a perfect size and is fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes clear pictures,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone is great but the screens are not as durable as recent models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you break the glass you can not just replace the glass it must be the entire screen which costs over twice the amount of just the glass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone and features as i have come to expect from the s8,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have always loved my galaxy's, i had two of them before this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i purchased this one because it was the best deal between it and the s7, i would have rather purchased the s7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunatly i had a broken screen after having it for only two days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it fell out of my pocket and hit the floor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have never had a phone break so quick and easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was extremely disappointed and i called samsung customer service directly, they fixed the screen at no cost to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the curved screen on this phone has no chance against any kind of wear and tear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the curved screen very fast great camera and battery is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far so good with this phone, just can’t get her off it now",,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from the s4 mini and what a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
replacement for a s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am enjoying bixby and several other options of the new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone that performs well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera works well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from the s6 and am very happy with the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does everything well and battery life is impressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought this for my son and he is extremely happy with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some bugs and some features that should have followed the phone but overall, still a great phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,
wonderful apps and speeds on the processor camera can’t complain same options as a note but small and fits the pocket,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what’s not to love?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is fast, has great battery life, and a beautiful display.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i needed a phone and was drawn too the samsung table of galaxy's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am amazed at the pictures it takes .easy too use very clear screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it for a great price, and the snapdragon 835 processor is a wonder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it still has the usual samsung shortfalls...tons of bloatware, poor antennas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the battery efficient processor paired with oled screen is netting me two days of average to heavy use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would recommend a different snapdragon 835 phone over this one ultimately,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone with a good camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"phone has received coverage in areas i struggled to connect before and was concerned about battery life but after turning off some apps, i found it's not a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
would recommend it to friends,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought this phone for my dad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is so pretty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have never seen a coral blue phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it works perfectly and the associates were very helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you best buy!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we needed a new phone carrier and with that new phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we took advantage of verizon's $350 off sale and choose the s8s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are wonderful!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"battery life is pretty good, plenty of good apps, the curved screen looks amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it takes great photos, best phone photos i have been able to take with a phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we bought both the blue and orchid grey, but the color doesn't matter because you just cover it with a case!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
just right size for your pocket,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone has the best camera and features of any phone out there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rounded screen edges cause problems with getting screen protectors that stick on the edges; i don't see the benefit of the rounded edges over the problems they cause.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"otherwise, i like the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i purchased the galaxy s8 and i am amazed by the quality camera and the screen resolution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only thing is the bloatware from samsung takes up a lot of space on the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would definitely it to a friend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone with the best camera i have had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery is great and the provided charger charges the phone fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, the phone has been great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
reception is better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wifi signals are stronger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
much faster than my samsung note 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is still plenty for me to learn about all that it can do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a great device.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would highly recommend the samsung s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has good design and look luxury.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might be heavier than iphone, but acceptable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
my phone has lots of nice features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes really nice photos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the case works well and seems to protect the phone although i haven't dropped it yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it serves the purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im very happy with my new phone!!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had the phone for a week now and i love it the only thing i don't like is that when i go to click on things i really have to click on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meets all of my requirements and is state of art, nice pictures",,,,,,,,,,,,,
my husband seems to be having better luck navigating his new s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are no good instructions,and i cannot even figure out how to install the sd card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am sure that if there were better help with the phone, then i might like it better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
att is horrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over $600 for 1 month of att service!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best phone i have ever had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks nice works great very happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from a s6 to a s8 and i love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never used the finger sensor on the s6 cause i found it difficult to read my fingers but s8 was simple, read without a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the iris is a great way to unlock the phone also, very easy to unlock and won't work with other people's iris except yours(i tried with many people).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's one thing that does annoy me, the bixby button on the side.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's too close to the volume button that i would accidently press it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but other than that annoying button, i am very pleased with my upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
couldn't wait to get my hands on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
took a little getting use to screen,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just switched from the galaxy s6 to the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in comparison, the new phone is thinner and has a larger screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are some nice new features such as the edge screen and bixby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with the upgrade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got this as an upgrade to the s6, which had me constantly connected to a power source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love that the battery lasts about 12 hours when not constantly in use and lasts a minimum of 10 when using it frequently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a little upset at the lack of a button (had the s2, s4 & s6), should have gone with the s7edge, but getting used to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
hate the bloat ware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall a great phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't a fan of the edge but this version isn't as annoying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the weight of the phone is good and the battery life is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fingerprint id is annoying but if you have a gear smartwatch that helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hope next time they have a better design,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trying out a samsung phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always been an iphone user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, so good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone was easy to use, all my apps and photos transferred over to the new phone with out trouble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 8s is everything they say, runs all game and apps well, has good battery life and takes great pic's",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"phone is nice, but rounded sides of screen are a bit annoying when texting/typing",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this samsung galaxy 8 is a nice upgrade from the 7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nifty gadget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excited to take this baby to the pool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guy that sold me the phone was super knowledgeable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he saved me extra money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone itself i'm still getting use to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it don't seem too different from the phone i had before this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe because i haven't took time to review all the features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall i really like the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it processes quickly and takes great pictures, but the battery life is not as good as my s7 active's was at 2 years old.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good phone, take great pics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i be having this phone for awhile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm enjoying my galaxy 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced my galaxy 5s and looked at iphones and galaxy products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chose the 8 over the 8 note because i like a smaller phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does everything i expect of a phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great photos, email, clear sound while on speaker phone, and a plethora of apps to enable me to work on documents from my phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still learning how to use bixby and having trouble learning how to ask the phone questions but overall i'm very pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"upgrading from lg lg4, this phone is more than expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is a perfect size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not too small and not too big.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly recommend getting a case because the phone can be slippery in hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"phone is great, have had no problems with it, would recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
great product definetly recommend to anyone great battery life,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had this type of phone cover for my last several phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the fact it covers the entire phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really enjoy the quality of the screen and the camera is fantastic!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its one of the best i have used..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy data and app transfer from old phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did not come wit a user guide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still old school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like to read the instructions otherwise, i miss features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recommend watching youtube videos, similar to my old g7 but with more features .",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a step up from the g7 , more features but yet just like the g7 extra screen area , but picture doesn't fill the who screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
youtube has alot more info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i think i will enjoy this product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought for my husband as an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he is very satisfied,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like all the extra functions, battery life, camera works very well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the size fits well in my pocket with a large screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've always been a samsung user and have loved this new phone since it came out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung cameras keep getting better and better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screen is gorgeous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really enjoying my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wish the camera was a little better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the phone but do not like the fact you can not change the battery and if you travel outside the country you have to wait until you get back to get another phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you have to buy a phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
put batteries in a phone you can get anywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the product is great, we are enjoying every bit of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is a great phone!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything about it is fast and perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my daughter got this phone as an upgrade from her previous samsung galaxy and she loves it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
says it faster and has more memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm an apple person so we always have the samsung/apple debate but she really likes it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my s6 screen died and was hoping to still get an s7 to keep my charge cables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately but fortunately there were none available and had to jump to the s8, which is an awesome phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amazing screen, bigger than my son's iphone 8 and everything works so smoothly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely recommend for anyone hooked on androids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no complaints with the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is faster and quality is good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've had a samsung galaxy s4, an s5 and now my s8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had an iphone in the past and cannot stand them!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my preference in samsung!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, samsung has ""some"" issues, but nothing worth me writing about here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
to each their own!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i own a samsung galaxy s8 and i love all the great new functionality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still getting used to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but, hey the service i got at best buy when i bought it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
transferring my information/files and photos was quick and easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
took pictures on my vacation and they were so nice and clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
runs so smooth and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no contest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my iphone 7 was too small, and my iphone 6+ was too big for my pocket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the galaxy s8 has the most beautiful screen i've ever seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bigger than the iphone 7, better resolution (pixels), better colors, better brightness, wow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the phone is smaller than my iphone 6+ because the whole thing is all screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm an android girl so this phone is amazing for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the clarity on the screen is really good and the sound is pretty impressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the second s8 i've purchased for the family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is better than the s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only issue i have is trying to find some of the programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent camera quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"easy to use , great camera , looks great , takes good pics",,,,,,,,,,,,,
had a note 4 prior to my galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the smaller size and the camera is better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd buy a galaxy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
muhammad was very courteous and helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however he used the pin to open the top of the phone for the memory card placement and must have forgotten to put it back into the box, cause i dont have it now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my 10th samsung product i love the ease of transitioning over,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone has been great so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have not had it for a long time but no complaints so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from a galaxy s5 and happy i did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was reluctant to upgrade from my galaxy s4 which was a workhorse and very reliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the s8 seems to be a good phone with lots of features i probably won't use since i am not a power user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my sone is enjoying his phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he has no complaints,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my son really likes the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he stands by the samsung phones!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am loyal to the samsung galaxy line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
terrific product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wonderful phone and general all around great device.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
videos stop during viewing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery runs hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i switched from a galaxy 6 to the 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a great thing that it's easy to switch and understand how to use this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the new gallery features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dads had samsung for several years upgrade to this he loves the style,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my 3rd galaxy series phone in a row after switching from iphones...!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very satisfied so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice phone, excellent camera and many new features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
customer service was excellent at the best buy mobile store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 2 b's (beth & ben) represent best buy mobile very well and i will continue to go there before anywhere else for phone servicing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love them two just as much as the phone...lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, very easy to navigate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad to have sd storage again after s6 model didn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bit smaller but good size screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but high prices are simply insane on all phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery life is so good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always a good buy and choice when buying a samsung galaxy and this one is just as awesome as the past ones... love the infinity edge!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got this phone awhile ago and boy, let me tell you all something; this phone is incredible and love the features from usb type c fast charging, bluetooth 5.0 dual audio, infinity screen with hdr quality and love my akg headphones for uhq audio for nice listening experience with my tidal subscription and it's worth the upgrade from my samsung galaxy s6",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from galaxy s6 to galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first of all the transfer or all data apps contacts pictures settings was done effortlessly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is easy to manuever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there were a few new features which was also easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sales person made the upgrade for both me and my wife a pleasureable experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung did a good job with the s8,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the feature and many functions that it has.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love the new s8, sleek, super functionable, great phone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love my new s8, still learning all it's capabilities, so happy i upgraded!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds great, durable, takes a banging and keeps on playing",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got this to replace my well-used galaxy s7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd had that phone for almost two years (i chose to upgrade early by three months due to a technical issue with the old phone).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, compared to my wife's much less used s7 they're very similar, although i think mine's just a touch faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried using the edge screen and quickly disabled it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the curved screen edge is more gimmick than useful imho, but maybe you will find it more to your liking than i did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the upgrade process was pretty painless thanks to them both being samsungs, although my battery was pretty close to dead when i got it home after they transferred it for me at the local bb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've not noticed any major differences with pictures although i understand the camera in the s8 is supposed to be better than the one in the s7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did look at some of the other android options out there, but since the pixel is only with verizon (and doesn't support qi charging?!?!?!)",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i opted to just keep on keeping on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have noticed the battery holds its charge much longer, but i suspect that would be true for any new phone compared to one that's almost two years old.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, this phone has been rock solid and i've not dropped any calls (the reason why i upgraded early).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"given the need and similar options, i'd get another one of these again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s a big upgrade from my galaxy 5 and the larger screen is an added bonus for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the additional features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bigger screen is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use and comfortable to handle.screen is small,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got this for my daughter, she loves it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
no complaints so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung galaxy s8 is the best one yet!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i only wish it didn't have the rounded edges on the screen, it should be an option, not the only option!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very durable and has great features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use it all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great phone, just bought this month but so far it’s a great phone for what i use it for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice display and light weight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"problem is, the charger has changed again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't by new chargers for older models if you are planning on purchasing a new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we now have 4 new chargers that are useless!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long lasting battery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more memory than old phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy with upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far so good, but i have not had it for very long yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this just may be the best samsung phone ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the display is beautiful and the overall quality seems solid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great product user friendly, takes awesome photos, long battery life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like the functionality of it as a smartphone owner.this phone has vastly improved from the og galaxy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
much needed upgrade love it and all the apps and camera is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since i have this phone i never have any problem with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm really like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really nice phone, easy to operate (very important to me) and has lots of great features",,,,,,,,,,,,,
we upgraded from the s6 to this phone and really enjoy the simple operation along with its powerful features,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got it so i haven't had much time to figure it out yet but so far i like it better than the s7,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best phone that i have had over the last several years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not sure why i did not switch a lot sooner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a galaxy s3 a few years back and was less than impressed with that phone so i ditched android and jumped on the apple bandwagon for a couple phones (5s and 6s).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as christmas 2017 fast approached, i found a deal on this phone through best buy that was too good to pass up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought the galaxy s8, switched back to android and haven't looked back since.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the giant, high resolution amoled screen is definitely its biggest selling point for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone itself is not much larger than the iphone 6s so it's fits great in my pocket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wireless charging is super convenient and its android os is easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great phone at a great price, very easy to use, and takes great pictures",,,,,,,,,,,,,
continue to appreciate the value and quality of samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"having an iphone for work, i have an understanding of both products and would always choose samsung.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screen size and resolution is great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes amazing pictures !,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen size and resolution is awesome .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera n other features are the best so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thought about getting an s10, but checked out the 8 first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
turns out it's exactly what i needed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have only used samsung galaxy models for several years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the new s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just not sold on the curved edges yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect phone for all needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"business, casual and every day needs",,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect phone for all needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"business, casual, everyday life",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like everything except the wfi connection, it doesn't stay as well as my old s4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love the slimmer design, great screen clarity, easy to use",,,,,,,,,,,,,
each new galaxy improves on the last model without fail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more intuitive options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone used to lg but this is so much better love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does everything i want it to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it runs well and things are smoother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much different from previous versions but it runs well and the brought back the sd card slot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 stars because it didn't take long to crack the screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
broke my s7 edge had to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the extra screen space!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing bad to say about the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would like to have had a reference guide included in the packaging... maybe i'm old fashioned but i like having a paper guide to refer to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"answers are mostly all contained in the phone, but you have to know where to find them; then try out the answer while going back and forth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
considering the price of the phone...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they could have thrown in a reference guide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went from a s5 to this so it was a much needed improvements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the extra screen and the actual size of the phone not to big or to small.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love using the edge and the always on display.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lot of nice new features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad i upgraded!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's really a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has a great camera and it's fast in all apps i use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
much better and improved than the s7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
runs much quicker and has a greater data capacity than the s7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
charges quickly and holds the charge longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new charger is more sturdy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my daughter just upgraded to this phone and absolutely loves it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would recommend to anyone lookong to upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice and fast a like it better then the old phone (the s6),,,,,,,,,,,,,
the iphone 6+ was too big.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the iphone 7 was too small.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i want a phone that has a big screen, but still fits in my pocket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the galaxy s8 is great - medium-sized, but huge, beautiful screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great functionality, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
my old samsung 6 died last week and i am very impressed with this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very fast charge and it lasts much longer than my old phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they get better and better each time they put one out and this doesn't disappoint.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my sons loves it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got this phone for my daughter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she loves everything about it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like this phone and its features so far, but time will tell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the curved screen looks really cool but it makes using a case and glass protector a little more challenging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall, a great phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i needed to update my galaxy s6 and overall pleased with the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not really a fan of the edge as it cuts off my video and pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also really wish that the fingerprint scanner was on the home button rather than on the back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but all in all, a great phone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my son is totally team theotherguy, but my husband and i are team samsung.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone never fails, has a quality battery and is very user friendly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my 3rd galaxy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i previously owned the s4 and s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they keep getting better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you samsung!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
powerful cell phone like the blue color and the curve in the scream.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the samsung 8 is a good phone, fast with a lot of capabilities",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would suggest any android user to purchase this s8,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was time for an upgrade, we still had the s4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone can be upgraded memory and has a great durability to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a nice phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the size fits nicely in your hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i sometimes forget that first and foremost this is a phone...but, not just any phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
..it's a samsung with every bell and whistle i could ever want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then it's a personal computer that rivals my desktop pc to the point that i think it's jealous regarding the time i spend on the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whew...powerful, beautiful and functional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't think to ask anything more from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the camera and other features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great upgrade choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great camera and screen,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is a little pricey,but they all are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone has the features i was looking for and replaced my galaxy s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far everything is working fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we replaced our s5s with these and are very happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they do everything that we need them to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great looking phone with crisp screen and beautiful photos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best vr phone i've used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best run for iphone's money yet!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
done with apple?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at the galaxy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and don't leave without geek squad protection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the world hates your phone and wants to crack it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have had this phone for over 6 months and i know there are things it can do that i still have not discovers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only problem i have had is because of the shape of the screen my glass screen protector would not adhere properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone has many features making my life a lot easier to control,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my daughter really enjoys this galaxy 8 phone and its features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought this for my wife on xmas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she is extremely happy with the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fast, lots of storage (64gb) and long battery life",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i purchased two new samsung s8 phones for holidays to replace my 2 year old samsung s6 models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, the performance (on sprint or wifi) isn't that much better than my 2 yr old s6 models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life even with power saver set is less than 8 hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is much better than the iphone 7 i upgraded from and in my opinion a strong contender to rival the iphone x with half the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the display is clear and crisp and actually very usable for a phone this size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect blend of form and function!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is also better than other galaxy's i have had in the past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is amazing bixbi is pretty cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my new samsung s -8 is the best phone i have ever owned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the camera is great, the screen nice and big, and super clear graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lots of storage,64 mb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
am very satisfied with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best phone yet that samsung has put on the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is fast, takes great pictures, and has more functions then i will probably learn before i upgrade in a year!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this phone has an amazing screen, great features and decent battery life!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded to this phone a few weeks ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's so much faster than the s6 was that we had before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"took a few days to get used to the changes between phones, but haven't had any problems beyond that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
clear and crisp viewing on screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
photos show great detail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use with extra features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new samsung galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything from the screen design to the speed is excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's easy two use and migrating from my old s4 was simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly recommended!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"phone works as it should, very similar to the s6 i would have liked to see some more noticeable upgrades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything works great and phone is quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only thing i’m not keen on is the curved edges, it’s much like the edge phones which limits case options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the screen is clear, and has a full screen mode option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"camera is great, as always!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery holds a charge for a couple of days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my new phone doesn't restart itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the picture on the screen is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm so glad that i upgraded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was long overdue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the galaxy s8 is an excellent smartphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is very attractive, lightweight and easy to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes terrific pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is very fast and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it charges quickly and holds the charge for a couple days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of the apps are less useful than they were on my old note 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems upgrading the apps these days allows them to do things faster with assumptions of what you desire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however some of the basic usefulness gets lost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another great samsung product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my last was a s5, they seem to last 2 years",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after having iphones for years it was time for a change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the look and feel of the samsung s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
being able to expand the memory was huge for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the wireless charging and being more water friendly then any iphone i've ever owned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will be sticking with samsung phones for a while!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i always upgrade my phones with best buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"easy to work with, find the best deals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is awesome and takes incredible pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the galaxy s8 is an outstanding phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
biggest improvement over the galaxy s5 is greatly extended battery life and an improved camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all photos are brilliant and clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i were in the market i would purchase this phone all over again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
function as expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way better than i expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so many cool features,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like all the special features -- and recommend a samsung class to learn how to use them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the iris tech phone lock works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hart to get a fingerprint in, but once i did it also worked very well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one small disadvantage -- keyboad a little small to use easily, however this is offset by how nicely phone fits in my hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
am going to try samsung pay as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like a great way to avoid carrying around all my credit and membership cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will take the rest of my life to appreciate all the apps available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
purchased 1 for myself and 1 for my daughter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, so good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with my purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use and sleek design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was time to upgrade from the old s4 model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new phone is sleeker in design and runs much quicker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sound is much clearer which is great for my aging ears.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast and easy with an outstanding camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slim size is great for fitting in my purse or pocket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
moved from the s5 to the 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy with this move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bigger, faster, and clean looking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
initially i purchased the verizon version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the touch display was not responding properly so i had to return it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and for some reason the verizon phone was more expensive than the unlocked version, even though vz blocked some original features and added their own sh.t i got the unlocked version.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
great product would buy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely worth the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what can you say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung makes some of the best phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't regret it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a pricey phone but well worth the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't know what i was missing compared to the s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the edge to edge large screen and crystal clear graphics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i fell in love with the color of this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had samsung s6 edge prior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love my upgrade camera is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice upgrade from a s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wish it came standard without the wraparound screen, though - it's just begging to be broken.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this doesn't have as much preloaded stuff as previous versions and i love the video call capability in the phone and not 3rd party.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has an awesome camera and still allows as cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1st phone was destroyed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got another,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my favorite phone thus far hands down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i don't really like phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is great when it comes to ease of access for apps, getting to texts and reading notifications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am also happy with the life of the battery considering the amount of time i spend on it daily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought for my hubby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we both love reliability of samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung is the only phone i'll buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never had a problem with one since 1997.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great features for an android smartphone & great hd qualify for watching movies,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better than my galaxy s4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would like to replace battery myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the orchid grey color.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 drawback-battery is not replaceable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i understand this that if it were replaceable, the phone would not be water resistant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought this phone because my husband has one and he could help me learn to use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, it's been everything i wanted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had it 2 months and still learning some of the many functions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i holds a charge for 2 days with a lot of use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i was real happy with the phone until i realized it is already obsolete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i love everything about this phone, the camera is great",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have always used motorola phones until this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is an amazing phone that is fast and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fingerprint reader to unlock the phone works without issues too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a samsung s5 and upgraded to the s8 which was a great choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone takes beautiful pictures and is user friendly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the voice quality is greatly improved over my s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am still learning features and differences, but at this point i am very happy that i upgraded to this phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems to have a fast processor and great sound quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i switched fro an s4 but the controls seem very intuitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife is happy with the phone other than the fact that it seems to update a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quality camera, high speed, and crisp picture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
my husband loves this android phone and says it’s the best one on the market,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too new for a thorough review but i will update this as i use it more,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good feel, nice screen
battery lasts longer than previous phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought my samsung galaxy s8 on 1/13 and there is a sale going on for the phone from $756 to $606 ($150 savings) and did not know there was a restocking and reactivation fee and thought the $150 could just be deducted from the cost of the phone and not go through all the hassle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am disappointed in that process, but not the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"couldn't be any happier with our purchases, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went from a flip phone to my samsung, have a lot to learn, but im working on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
takes great pictures!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am personally an apple person, but my husband wanted to switch over to samsung and he is getting use to the difference and really liking it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

always been a samsung fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love everything about the galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is the best android i've had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a lot better with a case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't take it out of my pocket for two weeks until i got a case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way too slippery and hard to hold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has a lot of cool features except it drops my phone calls more than my old droid maxx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bixby assistant still has a lot of work to become a moto or google assistant replacement,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still learning what this phone has to offer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far i have not been disappointed with this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after years of iphone ownership, i'm struggling to adapt to the android world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
going back to a samsung cell phone after a switch to iphone for two years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
find operation to be more comfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty good phone for half the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best price at the time for this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still learning the phone but it's pretty easy to use for the novice smartphone user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"works great, my daughter loves the camera and film",,,,,,,,,,,,,
over all better than the s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen is brighter and sharper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ease of operating is superb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bought this for my mom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she had an old lg that lasted for 3 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
she wanted the same phone as my wife and i had since we have had very good luck with our galaxy s7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far she has been happy with the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we just phone these phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got a great deal through best buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have had this phone for about a month and so far am very happy with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went from a note 5 to this and am very happy with the size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a samsung so the camera is phenomenal!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only issue i am having is figuring out how to get all of my notifications and settings back to the way they were on my note.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
otherwise very happy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bigger space for storage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the curve takes time to get use to if your coming from a flat phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone freezes at times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got this phone on black friday and am very happy with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks sleek and modern, and functions well too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"few complaints though: the phone does get laggy and glitchy sometimes, like once a week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i usually restart it and that fixes things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, i wish there was a non-edge version since i don't use the sides and i touch them by mistake very often, which is annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other than that it's a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life seems far superior to both my 4 and 6 edge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great price as well ... $300 off ... , and like the best buy exclusive blue color.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this a a huge step up from last model samsung device.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is samsung’s best phone yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone is very simple to use and functions well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera quality is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have only had this phone for a week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but having had the s5 and s7 this phone is superior to each of those easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from a galaxy s5 and so far i am happy overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still learning the new features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery life is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tried to switch to samsung from apple this was a nice phone but hard to get use to so i went back to apple,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung is my always preferred phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
family member had a lg that stopped working after about 18 month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gave an older s model that continued to work until it was time to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy with this upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went from an s5 to this s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the case is light and the color coordinates with the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've owned four galaxy phones prior to getting the s8, and i hated all of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
each one had some pro's but there were always a couple of deal-breaking cons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it just so happened that when my lg v20 died suddenly, the galaxy s8 got a really big discount from samsung so it ended up being so cheap that i couldn't pass it up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i crossed my fingers and hoped that maybe they finally got this one right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screen is spectacular.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seriously, best screen i've ever seen on a phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"better than the iphone, better than the lg v series, better than the pixel and pixel 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the camera, well it's hard to describe just how good it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm a former professional photographer and rarely leave home without an slr or mirror-less camera but i find myself not reaching for them as often now that i have the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my expensive cameras still get plenty of use, but the s8 has taken some absolutely stunning shots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's also wicked fast, had pretty good battery life, reliable fingerprint reader and the often omitted notification led on the front.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
so why not 5 stars?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got one major gripe and that's the fact that the phone is made entirely of glass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the front glass wraps around the sides and the back is also glass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might look good but, it is a fingerprint magnet, it's slippery and hard to hold, and i'm always terrified to drop it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went through a half dozen cases before finding one i really like and actually trust (spigen neo hybrid).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you prefer to carry your phone without a case, be warned that this thing is f-r-a-g-i-l-e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i switched from iphone back to android and it was a very seamless switch over using the included cable adapter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall i enjoy the functionality of the phone and the ease of integrating it into my daily needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after having an iphone before this i was nervous that my samsung galaxy would be hard to get used to but i had no problems at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow big up grade from samsung g 4 
lots to learn or relearn on this new 
samsung g8 phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love the new innovative s8.it has face recognition, no buttons, fingerprint unlock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazing clarity of camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought my note 3 was great, but as it aged, it began to drop calls if i wasn't on 1st floor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
my new samsung s-8 has performed excellently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's easier to handle, the camera is great, and i haven't had to leave the basement family room to have clear communication with friends and family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the sales person was great and the samsung rep was there and patiently explained to my wife and i, how to use the aspects of the phone that was new to us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
during any app call the other person not able to hear me properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is atrocious!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use this with a gear 3 and bt headset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after being with motorola for years, i am not accustomed to being tethered to a power outlet or having to wait hours for my phone to charge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung fast charging has a long way to go to catch up to motorola turbo charging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone size is about the best you get in a modern smartphone if you are one who does not wish to carry around a tablet as a phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung interfaces are quirkier that motorola or htc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no option for increasing the font size on the icons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no matter what you change, the font on the icons remains the same size, so i am forced to use a contrasting background or wear my classes to see the icon titles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
bixby and the permanent bixby button is a pain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s easy to press the bixby button accidentally and that button cannot be changed to use with something more practical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we should be able to choose an alternate app for the swipe left home screen and for what the bixby button does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did go back to best buy, but the only option i had to upgrade was to cancel the current phone deal and take a new phone with whatever current promotion was offered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i could not even just pay the difference for an s8+ with (theoretically) 30% more battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i cannot wait for two years to go by, so i can get back to motorola, and it won’t come from best buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great phone easy to use, has a great camera, and durable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"beautiful pictures, so compact, fits right into my pocket, very vivid screen, great for viewing movies and shows",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung galaxy s8 is a great cell phone that is easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is very intuitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in addition, a samsung rep was there to do all the work, and best buy had a great discount.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"been using this phone for a few months now, generally happy with the performance and battery life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for the most part you don't need to worry about it lasting through the day, though keeping a fast charger around is a good idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when charging it charges very fast, which is a major plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"software wise, i'm happy with the ""always on display"" while i turn most every other samsung feature off, including the annoyingly-named ""bixby"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one stupid thing is if you choose to use the google assistant instead of the evil ""bixby"", you won't be able to say ""ok google"" when the screen is off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully samsung allows this at some point in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took allot to get use to this phone.. the setup is different and hanging up after phone conversations can be difficult.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coming from the apple world it will open your eyes to what’s really out their to make your phone experience easier and or better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to many pros to count.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my husbands' s6 samsung fell out of his pocket face down on cement and the screen was smashed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no light or sound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he bought the new silver s8 and absolutely loves it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love my new samsung s8 phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a little larger than my former s6 phone, but it has so many new features .",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as i am not that ""tech savvy"", it will take me a little while to conquer most of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had 5 galaxies this 1 is the best yet may go buy another for a family member,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love this phone, love samsung products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a great phone and works as it should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery seems to last longer than the previous model..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what else would you expect from samsung?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another amazing phone and top quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a wonderful upgrade from my s7 edge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screen is bright and brilliant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fantastic pictures!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so many features, it's fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"old phone was crushed by accident, needed to replace quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"staff was great, professional, and very helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got me into a new phone quickly and easily, within 1/2 hour i had a new phone at a great price and was out the door.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad i chose to go into best buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung has really set the bar with this product so many features bixby is amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would recommend to anyone one even considering leaving apple for good,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huge samsung fan and this one doesn't disappoint.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has the best features of all the generation's and love that i can unlock with my face or eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"took a little to navigate as apps are set up differently than my previous s5, but didn't take long to get the flow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm always hesitant to upgrade my phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
newer doesn't always mean better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this s8 is fantastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same great feel as before with better technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is amazing i cannot believe it'll take me this long to buy a new phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is amazing and i cannot believe it's taking so long for me to get a new phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
purchase phone and had issues with dropping calls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
returned and got a different phone and new phone works great,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung phones are better than the iphones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know why people waste money on iphones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still discovering all this phone has to offer but i'm thrilled with the camera features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great sound as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the speedn of the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera and picture quality is very clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a lot of storage for people like me who likes to take a lot of pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a great upgrade from my previous phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at $300 off is was an unbelievable value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good quality phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great service preferred store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had this phone for over a year with no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife likes her phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has all the features he was looking for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my daughter likes her phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has all the features he was looking for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got it and cant beleive how nice it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love samsung phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't use the fingerprint reader due to new location, and have hit the bixby button several times accidentally, but battery life is great as well as picture quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the phone for christmas as a gift for myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i don't like about it is the battery is not removable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the samsung s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a really good phone and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with the samsung galaxy s8 so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use and has many great features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small size makes texting difficult as the keys are too small.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not have a home button makes it difficult to know which end is up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no noticeable improvement over the s7 and in some ways worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't real crazy about the sales person.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd had a samsung note 3 and wanted the note 8, but price was a deterrant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thrilled to take advantage of a black friday half price sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung 8 has met all my expectations and more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i enjoy how fast it is, it gets better reception than my old phone, has many features i haven't even explored yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgrades my 6 edge to this and i love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very durable too,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are so many great features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very pleased with this purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent product,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone is great love alll the features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery is good goes all day at normal use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great phone, great for multi-tasking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the ease of use as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone works really well great size and i like the edge on both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really nice biometric security.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very comfortable in my hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an excellent phone from samsung and which reinforces my faith in their products!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone has a great camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get great reception in places i didn't before with my old phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cons include unlocking my phone with finger prints doesn't always work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"purchased this phone on memorial day, really easy process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
had to return to store a couple days later though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wifi wouldn't connect to any network, had a hardware issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
swapped phone and haven't had an issue since.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bought this as an upgrade for my husband from the galaxy s5 and it is a great phone but you have to be willing to learn how to use all the features it has, which are many!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has a great camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a phone for beginners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my sons and i love the phone and we are all iphone owners!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the quality of pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use when we upgraded from the galaxy 6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a great phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is one of the best phones i have had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the battery is the best part, very long lasting",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very nice phone i recommend this to users of samsung phones 
the camera is excellent the voice quality is excellent and the features are numerous 
video quality is very good 
battery lasts longer on this phone than prior versions and has a battery saving feature which i really like .",,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone with unlimited possibilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive not even scratched the surface.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great features, fast and great size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the phone and im glad i brought the phone ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung is simply the best!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife has had her s8+ for a while so i got the s8 for myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very good, very smart too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
best samsung galaxy yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"camera great, easy to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything about this phone is top notch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very fast and responsive, the camera is the best low light phone camera i have used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone works great and has the best screen out there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good phone not great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung enthusias.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bixby is junk and talk to text feature has a serious lag if it even works at all!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at all the android choice out there before purchasing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would not recommend for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't had a new phone in 5 years so i love this new samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what more can i say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tim hutchens sold us on these phones and we are so glad he did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from my droid turbo 2 which was not connecting to our wi fi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the galaxy s8 seems to be able to do it all in addition to being very attractive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screen is vibrant and the display is unbelievable!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
takes great pics and seems very responsive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my first samsung and although i've only had it a couple weeks as of now i love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is my first samsung phone and i'm really happy with it so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my previous phone was the lg g3, which i'd had for around 2.5 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was the best one i'd ever had and certainly lasted the longest even after being dropped pretty much on a daily basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had planned on getting the g6 originally but it wasn't available at my local store​ so i got the s8 and i'm glad i did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's great looking and isn't uncomfortable in the hand, the camera takes some pretty amazing pics, no lag or other issues with speed or capability, and the battery lasts all day with moderate to heavy use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i'm not that fond of is the fingerprint scanner location but that's not a big deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do miss being able to tap the screen to turn it on like i could on my g3 and the remote control app on the g3 was pretty handy too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall, i'm pretty happy with the s8 and definitely recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as of today, it’s the only phone that checks all of my needs: excellent rear camera, excellent front camera, water proof, dust proof, wireless (fast) charging, full-day battery life, a headphone jack, a micro sd card slot, fingerprint scanner, and after using the s8, bluetooth 5.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the infinity display screen makes watching videos awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes excellent quality pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had to take back my original purchase because it was internally bad but new one is good so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have continued to purchase the samsung galaxy series of phones and have yet to make a complaint.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone works flawlessly so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"speed, resolution and the external memory card were all a plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
big improvement in battery live.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy setup at best buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife loves this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this beats all the other smart phones i ever had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"works great, size is great and screen is very clear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera works great too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best phone i've ever had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great screen and easy to see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use and wonderful battery life and pictures are amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have not had a new phone in 4 years, am really enjoying this one !",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's everything i expected and much more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gave less than '5' because voice dictation doesn't seem to function.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
support says something wrong w/samsung keyboard but now has stopped working w/google keyboard (which is inferior to the samsung).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has all the bells and whistles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"easy to use and waterproof, which is good since it spends a lot of time near the pool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
great cell looks great and performs as good as expected for a new samsung device,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is so light weight and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has the slim feature but ease of finding things and the actual apps are easy on the eyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't learned all my s8 can do yet but i do love it!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"missed my sdmicro card slot (had galaxy 6, before that galaxy 4, 3 etc... purchased an iphone for husband and it's okay for his needs (and hes a total newby to smart phones lol ;) but i ♡ lots of options!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
always loved my samsung phone and each one gets better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
infinity screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only wish was that the pop up keyboard had bigger keys because my eyes aren't good and i make a lot of typos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best camera of any phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's thinner so it fits in my pocket even with the case on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really nice phone, no problems or hiccups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
iris scanner works just as well looking down at your phone as it does looking straight at your phone as long as your eyes are the correct distance away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fingerprint scanner takes about a day to adjust to then it's just second nature like any unlock method if that's your preference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is a great phone, easy to use, nice camera and really great voice recognition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
blows the iphone out of the water and is a nice upgrade to older samsung phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice upgrade from my s6, will definitely continue to purchase galaxy phones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had a screen issue within one week, but the phone was replaced and i've had nothing but a good experience since.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
wish the edges were more compatible with a glass protector but i've adapted to using just a skinomi and it looks great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first time i've ever bought a phone that was the top of its kind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
splurged when we changed carriers and i'm very glad i did!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love having enough space for the apps that i want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also like the buttons and their placement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a really nice phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my third galaxy (previously an s3 and s5) and this is another great phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the battery lasts more than a day with regular use, and the finger print id works slick on the back, even if you do end up smudging the camera quite often.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my third galaxy phone and i really enjoy the features!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the software is the best it's ever been.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the experience is smooth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've not ran into any issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love that it is water and dust proof.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would buy a case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the all glass body will not hold up well against concrete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone performs as expected from other reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone is slippery and requires a case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nearly all cases in the store obscure the specialty color of the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had all the samsung phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this one is absolutely the best!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"camera is amazing, quality of the pictures are awesome!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine broke when it slipped out of my shirt pocket, fell total of two feet, onto its edge and shattered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"works, but essentially useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had no insurance, warranty doesn't cover breakage, and i now have a second one, for full retail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"works great, but i now have a protector, which i've never had before, and a full insurance plan for two years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"call me stupid, i love the phone and it works great, still rather have this than apple, but i swear that, for all its rounded beauty, the s8 is more fragile than prior phones with metal or plastic edging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
just so you know.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung galaxy s8 is an excellent telephone for replaceing my tired galaxy s3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was looking to replace a phone from a different manufacturer and as i was getting ready to pull the trigger on an s7, i jokingly asked when the s8 was due out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after a bit of hemming and hawing, i was told that it was scheduled for the spring of 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
(i think the salesperson was worried about missing a sale.),,,,,,,,,,,,,
no date had been set for release but i'm glad i waited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this device works great with both cars, chromecast, as well as a smart tv.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the vr has also been fun thus far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the edge side menu is a great feature for favorite apps, weather, most used contacts and several other options that i have chosen to skip for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
my favorite feature is the fingerprint security.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i hated having to mess with passwords and pins just to access my own phone, especially at home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like that nobody else can gain access, and at the same time, i don't feel like i have to ask for permission to check email or texts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also use my device as a second backup for all of my music, photos and personal files.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the extra storage is wonderful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't even mentioned that the screen is beyond fantastic and the basic screens have a smooth look to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, i might add that if you ever need it, it's a phone too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from s4 mini.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
width is similar which fits my hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
length is okay - i like smaller phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the camera!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finding my way not as hard as i thought it might be moving from the mini in easy mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would have like to get a quick guide in the box rather than having to download a manual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fits nice in my hand, light and easy to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is fantastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loads of storage i really needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lots of useful features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very fast and responsive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera takes excellent photos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
display is bright and vibrant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery is a little better than average.the only down side is bixby isn't fully fictional yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still hate the bixby button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but overall love the improvement going from a s6 to a s8,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great camera, great screen, good battery life (getting 5.5 hours screen on time, haven't tried any powersaving modes yet), and performance is great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have seen no lag like the samsungs of old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really enjoy the size and feel in the hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my favorite thing about it is that the screen looks exactly the same outside as it does inside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no more straining to see my screen in direct sunlight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i wish was different about this phone is that the bixby button should be remappable because other than the camera search feature bixby is a completely useless clone of google now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wont count bixby as a negative though because its an extra and doesn't take anything away from an otherwise great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lastly the fingerprint location is blown way out of proportion by tech reviewers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use mine daily with either hand no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the phone which has a great camera looks great and works like a phone should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the phone best buy techsnicoans very helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really enjoy the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent so far amazing camera much better than my s5,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very happy with the new galaxy s8, great improvement to battery life, lasts all day even with my heavy data usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"processing speed also great, no lags even with numerous apps loaded and running in background.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this galaxy 8 is the best!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is easy to hold, easy to use, must i say beautiful.great deal at best buy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been an avid android / samsung customer for years now and they never disappoint!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is awesome very slim compare to others brand such as the iphone, lg, google, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the display is the greatest i seem do far and the phone also fits in ons hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the thing i don't like is the fingerprint reader on the back, i sometimes have problem opening the phone with my fingerprint.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
other than that is the best phone by far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
new phone.. easy to use... works good .. love the camera,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this phone seems to have so many features, i havn't even tried them all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it will be a phone to have for years of great fun, especially with the camera!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like durability and having to worry about not only the glass front but also the back?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so much for looking good till it drops and cracks, and if you protect it with a case then you don't even see the back of the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
otherwise a great phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great new features on this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life a lot better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fantastic camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome phone good battery excellent camera and over all great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"frankly, i am not usually on the cutting edge, but this phone is definitely all that and the above.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was upgrading from the s4, so this phone has been quite the upgrade for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
wqhd screen resolution to go along with the infinity screen is simply amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery performance has been excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no complaints...

look forward to seeing what bixby might add to the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had every galaxy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is by far the best phone samsung has launched.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks great feels great and performs like a champ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery is incredible,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have been an owner of the samsung galaxy s6, s7 and now the s8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really love the phone, simplicity, intuitiveness and overall performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had a samsung phone for over six years and wouldn't go with any other brand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use and love theboverside screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have the s8 and s8+ and both work way better than previous s7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is a big improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
smooth and quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love my new samsung s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"beautiful screen ... high quality ""build"" ... and the thing is fast!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
plus my battery lasts much longer than my s6 ... often ending the day with 30% or more battery without any mid-day charging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love my gs8 has the power i need to run anything including my home automation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the gs8 does not skip a beat .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
size is perfect and camera is awesome .,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't say enough food things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung knocked it out of the park with galaxy 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best cell phone ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
full of new features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the infinity screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is great so far, hopefully it continues!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from an s7 and it's a step up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like the finger print sensor on the back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the edge send like a gimmick, but it didn't really get in the way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far my samsung galaxy 8 has been great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the screen size and all the extras highly recommended,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love getting a big screen on a phone that is easy to handle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no bixby really doesn't matter, because i use google anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the galaxy s8 is the best phone on the market today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it gives you more customization than the iphone and compared to other android flagship phones it has the best screen and a great camera that makes it stand out above the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is actually pretty good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm usually able to make it through an entire day without needing to recharge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loving my samsung 8 so far!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was happy to get lower monthly payments by purchasing from best buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great customer service, and a free wireless phone charger as an add-on!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone was everything i had hoped for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the wide, curved screen is nice for watching videos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, when the phone is upside down, the screen is visible from the edges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of features that i'm still finding out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have been a samsung fan for many years now and have owned the gs4 and gs6 edge, the gs8 is incredible and doesn't disappoint.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the finger print sensor is not as big of an issue as people are making it out to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it works fantastic and the phone itself is stunning and super fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hasn't lagged or hick-up'd since i've had it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got this on april 21st and love it... if you're looking for something great, this is it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an awesome phone you can do so much with the phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was definitely in need of an upgrade considering i had an s4 still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone was exactly what i was looking for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great all around phone so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent camera and picture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huge screen but the phone fits comfortably in my hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best phone i have every own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love everything about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really enjoying all the features of the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only issue i have is the side menu, it's a little difficult to access.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm sure i just need to fine tweak things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like samsung products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded and love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is wonderful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only bad thing is a lack of auto syncing with computer calendar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
switched from an iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent photos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it fit the phone perfect, was easy to install.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
sleek and stylish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to learn and use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you like being advertised to every 5 seconds this is a great phone for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung blew it again.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a s8 it's a beautiful phone but i dropped it less than 3ft in a new otter box and the back glass broke because the whole phone is glass!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy only has a 14 day return period on cell phones and this happened on the 17th day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a happy customer,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found that they made the extra edge on the phone has no use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did not use the edge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the quality of the sound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did not try the camera yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still in a process of learning how to use this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, i like this phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"takes great pictures,
battery last long, easy to operate!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is working great so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is super fast and smooth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it charges really fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is excellent and has a lot of different filters to choose from.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sound quality is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also like how samsung is so customizable!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aside from that, i'm thankful that i didn't buy the screen protector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope they fix that soon :),,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best phone i have ever had it's great looks awesome don't hesitate buy this phone you won't regret it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at first, i would have given the phone 5 stars...now only a 3 1/2-4 stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i still like my phone, the size, the features, but the battery leaves something to be desired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really need a phone that i don't have to constantly charge and my galaxy is only a few months old, yet i have to charge it much more than i anticipated for such a new phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a galaxy s4 but finally decided to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what a great improvement in screen quality, functionality and memory size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
much better than my s6 which did not have the option of adding a sd card,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the quality of the new samsung phones!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely a lifelong customer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy was able to easily transfer information from old phone to this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we purchased the galaxy s8 from clarence and he was extremely helpful and fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we saved $ because of the promotion that best buy was having and we absolutely love the phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will always go to best buy for our cell phones!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new coral blue galaxy s8 is the most elegant and comfortable phone i have ever had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent resolution and camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have never bought a phone that was new on the market, but i am glad i chose this phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went into best buy because i really needed a phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my was done and wouldn't last the day out but was also a cheap $20 go phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is very much an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still learning how to navigate everything but so far so good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my favorite part right now is the stickers that you can apply when taking pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my kids love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and another advantage is that you can use an sd card in it, which you can't do in an iphone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish they would have had the black in stock but the phone is covered up by the case for the most part so it's not even an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still learning how to switch apps and get what i need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the operating system is so different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use has lots of options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love all of the new features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loveee the color!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks very different than other phones i had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the camera,the filters, the personal assistant bixby are amazing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you can add a memory card!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best samsung phone so far!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it fits in my pocket, unlike the new and ""better"" phones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"replaced a stolen one (stupid me, no insurance).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in store service was good, but it always takes some extra tech support to make sure all my contacts are available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like my mom, but in the switch, her contact info disappeared!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this new galaxy s8 from samsung is a wonderful phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lots of new features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems to have a better battery life and cleares sound,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this phone is easy to use, fun to personalize, and operates well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only downside i have to this phone so far is the camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't get me wrong, it takes nice photos, i just feel as though even on my s6 that i had prior, the quality was a little better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the sound quality of the phone is decent, best i have heard on a samsung.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely an upgrade with ease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"larger screen, much more memory and so easy to use!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great phone, i bought it for 500 $ 
fast, good battery, nice quality camera",,,,,,,,,,,,,
am learning a new benefit daily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and each one is something helpfully to my daily use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4th samsung phone, great as always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
good service at best buy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just wanted to contribute a bit to say that i am an imac and ipad owner, and my parents and daughter are on their apple family plans with their imacs, macbooks, ipads, and iphones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i decided to upgrade my iphone 7 to a galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've been disappointed with all the bugs from apple lately, and i just wanted to try something different.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am glad i got my galaxy s8, and i may just stay with samsung for my phone, or at least feel comfortable choosing whichever phone is best at upgrade time, rather than feeling scared to leave apple due to the convenience factor of being entirely within the apple ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"samsung, google, and at&t make it very easy to have all the conveniences you need as an ""apple dude"" with a galaxy phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so if you're an apple consumer and curious, take the plunge!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still learning how to use the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has plenty of potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent visual and sound..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's fast, multitask friendly, and can handle a heavy user.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to mention an amazing camera!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best phone so far!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love love love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great memory, preloaded apps, easy to use and amazing photos",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung galaxy s8 is exactly what i was wanting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone clarity is great; it is easy to use; and the camera takes wonderful pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had no problems with this smartphone and will use it for a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me samsung s8 is the best phone and i hope i will see asap on sale at bestbuy.com because i got buy another one and last year samsung for samsung s7 had an free 32 inch tv samsung and maybe this year samsung for s8 will have the same offer on sale..,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought this as an add on with my note 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's just as amazing as note 8 in a smaller format.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the galaxy phone is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would recommend it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
solitaire has never been so vibrant and responsive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"excellent battery life allows for hours,maybe even days, of lonely game playing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"purchased this phone after owning lgs, and sony.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is by far better and the 64gb is the best thing i ever decided to get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always has lots of storage for apps i can not store on my sd card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very easy to operate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still learning all the features of my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way better than apple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"has great features and is waterproof, which is grrrreat!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love the memory, camera, and bixby is so helpful!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

love the analog clock on the lock screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great phone and easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many nice upgrades from my s4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best feature is the camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
charges fast and holds the charge for long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with this purchase-especially with $350 off!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a great upgrade from my galaxy s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can go all day long without plugging it in which is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice design also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
350 dollars off this made a great xmas present for my mother unit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am gifting this phone but i can tell u it was delivered way earlier than expected!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and all seems well with the phone do far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
replaced an existing s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has great quality and is very reliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is also very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only downside is that the phone is glass on both sides and is very slick, put on a case and that problem does not exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the form factor and the screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery life seems to improve with time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am very happy with my purchase of the samsung galaxy s8 phone.i will buy another when this one is gone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is a fast and easy phone to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does take time to adapt to the lack of a home button, but you appreciate the sleek design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrading from galaxy s4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"impressed with updated features, including improved camera and increased battery life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
we were in need of an upgrade from our s5s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we couldnt be happier with the resolution & functionality of this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"replaced an s6 with this s8, two weeks ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like the size, quality of sound, pictures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had a little trouble converting to verizon from at&t, but got it resolved fairly quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from the s6 and got it on black friday weekend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does everything the s6 does and better crystal clear picttures fast operating system amazing video playback,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and has been super aweome to use,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i’m an a ios fan, but must admit that my sons phone it’s pretty awesome, pic's are far way better than even iphone 8+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy with this product,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it feels very sleek way better upgrade from an s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it feels good but would recommend a case,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm extremely happy with this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought it on the black friday deal offering $350 off and i couldn't be happier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery life of this phone is phenomenal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am an avid phone user, (social media, snapchat, texting, spotify, etc.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this battery lasts me 16 hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the first phone i have ever owned that lasts me the entirety of the day even with how frequently i use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the screen is beautiful, the display is next-level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm extremely impressed and i'm so glad i chose this over the iphone x. i got this phone after already owning a galaxy, and best buy transferred everything from my old phone in 10 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is the best purchase i have made in a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been wanting to upgrade my phone but didn't want to pay so much per month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the black friday price was half the regular cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, i love this phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
signed up for verizon and can not activate verrizon needs # and i don't no what it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eyelike how fast the camera takes pictures the screen and all of the apps that are added on,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so much better than an iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so happy that samsung is continuing their excellence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got rid of s6 terrible battery this phone alot the same with many better things battery better but nit great,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife and i recently upgraded our galaxy s5’s to the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone is an overall nice improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the one gripe so far is both of our s8 phones don’t deal well with glass screen protectors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screen sensitivity is greatly reduced with a glass type protector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so much so that i ended up removing my glass screen protector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our s5’s both had glass screen protector without issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upon doing some research we are not the only ones with this issue on the s8’s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from the s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically the same as the s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a few improvements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes fantastic pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
live the phone i purchased at the visalia best buy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love this phone, great camera, great battery life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far it’s working as promised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was relatively easy to set up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will never buy an apple iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung phones are so much better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the s8 a couple months ago and i have no problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the double edge rocks!.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen resolution is very good and vivid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried switching from an iphone to the samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after havng it for several weeks (to give it a fair chance), i am disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will switch back to the iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best phone on the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pick up to see for yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded to samsung s8 from note 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use great pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung phone is what i expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend to friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my only complaint is the home screen button seems to have disappeared after a recent update on certain apps,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first phone for my grandson.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many good features and he loves it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm glad to come back to samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 has a great camera and many features to make it easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the phone got it at a great price works great would buy again,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not to sure if the edge is good or bad, but good so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely an upgrade from my s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the sleek design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my second smart phone and by far the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the help i received from the staff was excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they answered all my questions and i had a few since at my age (69) technology sometimes over whelms me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice phone but having a hard time getting used to coming from an apple,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excellent qaulity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good color screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought this because i like to listen to music while my phone is charging and i refused to pay for the iphone's new wireless ear buds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i love the curved screen, and the way the glass goes all the way to the edge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plus, it is the perfect size--it maximizes screen size, but is still easy to use with one hand reaching from corner to corner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
su.sung never disappoints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love all the great additions to the new samsung s8+,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife and i were both in need of a phone upgrade and we jumped when we saw best buy was offering $300 back on the new samsung s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"having researched the phone thoroughly and found that almost everyone was pleased with the new phone, we didn't even hesitate to go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm pleased to say that within the first month, the phone has not disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fast, efficient, great camera, quick response, larger screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in love with this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, best buy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and thanks, samsung!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my wife and i each bought the s8, and the learning curve from my s5 was frustrating for a couple days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my wife who is less tech-savvy, and was upgrading from a s4, had a lot of difficulty adjusting to the changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
she is happy with it now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"faster, cleaner access and better battery life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the wider screen to edge makes for a better reading of email experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, i waited forever to upgrade my phone (from an s5).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
that phone ended up being so glitchy...(my second one) i couldn't stand it any longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this phone is much more advanced than the s5, it'll probably take me a while to figure out it's full potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, i was very used to width of the s5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is considerably slimmer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just have to let you know, get a protective case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if you donr like or prefer having a phone case, get one.even the back of this phone is made of glass (not gorilla glass).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was sad to have dropped it not even a week of getting the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i cracked the back a little bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have it in a case now, so you can't see it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aside from that, its a beautiful phone, light, sleek and dare i say sexy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought t he samsung 8 specifically for it's photo abilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it hasn't let me down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has a lot of features which i haven't even began to explore, but my favorite feature is the camera.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also let's you shoot in raw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was really surprised to get such greay fireworks photos grom hnd holding this camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just set it on auto & it does the rest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can even review the camera settings after you take a pic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had been wanting to upgrade for sometime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this one was worth the wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"love the phone, just amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend to my friends and family,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes great pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my brother loves his new 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he said pretty much every feature is better than the 7 he just had,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decided to switch from apple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a huge upgrade from my iphone 6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone is a bit tall and even with my long fingers it can be hard to reach the top.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't found an email app that i like as much as apple email.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"other than that, i really like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
having a full keyboard is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen is incredible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely takes some getting used to as i have never used an android device before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, i'm glad i switched!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"picked up a second s8 for our account - best buy had it on sale and it was almost half of the price i paid at product launch, the s8 has an excellent battery which lasts over a full day with medium usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
display is awesome!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this phone is the best so far, enjoy using , whit no problems",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was to replace my wife's s3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aside from the normal learning curve and annoyance of having to set things up, this phone is very nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great camera, good battery life and wireless charging were great features but the kicker was the price!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you best buy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only complaint is trying to find case and screen cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a continuation of a great product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone looks great and in your hand it just seems to fit perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is easy to use and the pictures look great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is so much that you can do with this phone that it is a little overwhelming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does all things well, and with minimal battery use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the end of a day busy with calls, texts, and reviewing email, it still retains over have it's battery capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the display is crystal clear, and enlarged with the wrap around screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am enjoying my new samsung galaxy s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it feels so sleek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
picture quality is incredible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great camera good sound quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like the size bixby is cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"camera is ok. sony xperia z3v takes much clearer, detailed and sharper raw photos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung display is nicer so photos appear to be better than it actually is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone has great clarity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use and to set up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice feel to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with the purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would buy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely like the plus version,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like my new phone but still learning how to operate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very sleek, even with a case it fits nicely in my pocket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very fast and a great screen resolution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only down side is the height.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wear large gloves so i have slightly larger than average hand and i can't reach the whole screen while only using one hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they used to try to make phones as small as possible, soon we'll all be carrying 30"" screens with us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
slim design disappears in my pocket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long battery life - have yet to get it below 50% in a long day of use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always on display is nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i don't like is the darn bixby button i always seem to hit by mistake because of its location.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needed to upgrade my wife's ancient samsung s3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an s7, and i was worried about some reviews of the s8's more delicate case glass (bought the extra warranty and a good case).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the wife loves the speed of the phone, the battery life and the screen (i'm jealous too now!).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the one knock is for the typical bloatware from both samsung and verizon (i'd throw in google too, but their software is often helpful, unlike bixby).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"speaking of bixby, i don't want to use it, and there's a dedicated button for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a waste of a button, plus too close to the volume.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if you disable bixby, it still wakes up when you hit the button.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also intrudes on the camera screen too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am really loving this phone especially on the verizon network.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i previously had a samsung galaxy s5 on sprint and liked it but had no idea what i was missing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this phones camera, sound quality, display, different messaging features offered through verizon are just phenomenal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am so glad we decided to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i previously had the s5 before upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so fast, sleek, and big.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is awesome too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i got it at a great price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we had to get a new phone when our old one died before a big trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fortunately verizon had backed up our apps and all the contacts with the groups so we were completely put back together after the salesman moved our sd card with all our pictures and some apps to the new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"another samsung person at bestbuy had moved all our pictures and some apps, those that could be moved, to the mini sd card a few months ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
hint: you have to use the file manager instead of gallery to move the pictures and apps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very happy with verizon, bestbuy and samsung",,,,,,,,,,,,,
start by saying i got the s8 because i needed a new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have had a galaxy since s3, which was my favorite version of this phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
s8 has made some great improvements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however, the one area that they (samsung) have preached is bixby.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
yesterday (7/20/17) my bixby finally had a voice and can understand some basic voice inputs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the phone was released without bixby fully functional that is the minus one star.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outside of that great phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would argue for most of us the phone is top-notch i just find it annoying it was released and not fully functional.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its the new s8 that my daughter got for 16th birthday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife got the 8+ a few months back and as equally impressed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the samsung pay and the camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally no more physical home button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a beautiful screen but hate that screen is over exposed and screen protectors have a hard time staying on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all glass to needs a case, though i am watching shows on drama fever and no one uses a case (for promotional purposes) but still.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the flip case does a nice job of protecting screen when not in use but still vulnerable when being used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was purchased for my son after his s6 died one month shy of 2 years old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he loves this phone with all of its new features (such as the edge, always on display, retinal scan, bixby, and expansion sd slot) and improved performance and camera.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"movies don't look like they are on a phone, more like a tiny 4k television.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
solid construction and flawless operation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have now been a samsung convert for several generations, starting with the s5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is a sleek, well-designed phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very responsive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the camera and the ability to have dslr like controls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am always amazed at the quality of low light pictures this camera can take.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast n get service from the best buy employees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use durable and great technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone also constantly updates and has apps that provide day to day trackers and reminders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really love the galaxy s8 phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the interface is quick and the performance has been great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life has been very good even when listening to music and working out with the screen on the whole time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bixby voice still doesn't work, but is launching shortly, o hopefully that will make this phone even better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung's galaxy s8 is an easy phone to use and enjoy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is outstanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you previously owned a samsung, you will find the s8 has upgraded features, apps, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it charges quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"once you become a samsung phone owner, you happily will stay with samsung!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my daughter and husband also got one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i usually hate upgrading my phone because it takes me a while to get used to a new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the people at best buy answered all my questions and made my experience even better!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has faster internet, great calling features, etc!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is so much better than any other phone i have had in the past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the people at best buy were extremely helpful, too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would definitely recommend this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is better than my previous samsung phone in every way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has every feature that anyone could possibly need on a phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the camera takes great pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before this phone i had only owned iphones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my first galaxy phone so i am adjusting to the differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the photos are the best part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes really clear flattering photos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got this phone instead of the iphone 7 and am very happy with my decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however i don't like that you have to pay to subscribe for non spam calls and a i miss itunes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"next phone i get in 2 years or so will most likely be an iphone, but for now this works for what i need it for and is still an attractive smart phone that takes fantastic photos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"phone looks, works great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i always get samsung phones,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took a little bit to get use to it but it is easier every day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wanted to upgrade my phone, so i went with samsungs8 and fell in love with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has great features and a great camera as always,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a july 4th sale and an e-mail coupon i paid $200 less than at verizon and i also got a $100 best buy gift card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"phone was set up at store, and data from my old phone was transferred.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the appearance and performance is worth buying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"besides, the front selfie camera is the best i ever seen, by far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
going from an iphone to a samsung took a couple of days to learn differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a great phone with great features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is clear,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we had the former version of this phone and was upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we were already pretty much settled on selecting this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's newer slender design was the biggest reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been and will continue to be a samsung phone user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the new s8 is easy to work, great display on the screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have owned the galaxy s6, s7, s7 edge and this one (s8).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this iteration is by far my favorite.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great screen, fast processor and very light.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very easy to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice amazing camrea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was upgrading from a galaxy note 5 and wasn't sure if i wanted to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am glad i did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is blazing fast and has an amazing screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love everything about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had it for over a week now, huge fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't wait for bixby assistant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am very happy with the s8 and new functionality of android.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screen size is excellent and the thin feel is very ergonomic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought this as an upgrade/replacement for my iphone because i did not like the newest iphone which requires wireless earbuds to charge the phone while listening to music.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am extremely impressed with the screen and camera quality of the samsung, and very happy with the overall phone quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is definitely an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"easy to hold, talk and text.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
pictures are very sharp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as soon as i took the phone out of the box to charge, the error message ""moisture in charging port"" popped up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like if you have sweaty hands then this might pose an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
besides that i wasn't fond of how the edges of the phone resembled the edge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
much better battery life is the most noticeable improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the s7 edge screen was also super fragile, the s8 is more durable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone works very well and takes great photos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife uses it and has zero issues with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's no iphone but it's a close second.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been looking at the s8 for awhile but wanted to read more reviews before making the purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, i'm happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
pictures are clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only have it a couple of weeks and like it so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the one thing i wish i could change is the time on the screen so it would be on one line instead of two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great so far, big change from the 5, many cool features, vr is great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
samsung nailed it with this one!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ease of access, security, and improved water resistance make this their best product to date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can't go wrong with this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not ready to revise all feeling not so good will use,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generally works well but sometimes when i'm talking on phone i will get a vibration and lose my call.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will stop in and talk to samsung agent about this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, tired of all the ads to purchase extra stuff which i find annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the ability to surf and talk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
main reason i got the new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an upgrade from s6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good solid phone, very similar to previous samsung phones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"getting used to the edge component, and i don't completely like it but i don't completely hate it either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aspect ratio of the screen is odd, with the ultra long height and condensed width - not the greatest for viewing video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is very slippery - i dropped it twice within a few days, so i would recommend purchasing a case that offers some traction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am a galaxy person this is my 3rd phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had the s3, s6, and now the s8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far it's been a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love trading phones at best buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are the best, so patient to answer all the questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is the best phone i ever had, i would recommend this phone to everyone",,,,,,,,,,,,,
much faster than the s5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting use to the curved screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has an amazing camera with cool features built in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easy to use with one hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not heavy or clunky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got the galaxy s8 to pair with vr goggles and 360 camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for the goggles at least, it does not disappoint.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still have to try it with the 360 camera before i can provide a review.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
!great phone and i’m still learning new features!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sur yet if it’s worth the extra cash but i am enjoying it if i can just remember that there is no home button!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera quality is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
charges very slow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hate that you can’t see the battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve had almost every iphone in the past and before this had the iphone 7 plus 128gb black.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screen is stunning and new features are a nice change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the first few hours it can be quite a change navigating the new gestures of your a previous iphone user but you quickly start t adopt to the new gestures quite easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the sound is much better, wireless charging is a quite usable feature and yes animojis are quite fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
face id is great but the extra swipe in the beginning is a little taxing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully more apps will integrate face id from touch id as i have had to enter passwords where i previously used touch id as that is not an option as of yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so in conclusion the iphone x feels like an actual upgrade compared to the past of a few new features not a new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s defiantly worth the purchase as it is quite enjoyable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pictures it take look great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the face recognition and it is very fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with the purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does everything i needed it to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to have the plus size phone for screen size but they were a bit bulky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is bigger screen size but less bulky without home button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve always had android phones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after seeing one of these in person i couldn’t resist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best iphone ever !best phone i have ever owned!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone is easy to use and the larger screen is perfect for pics and videos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can get this phone please do, you won’t regret this purchase!the face id works better than the fingerprint id and i love not having the home button!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the iphone x!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the iphone x is is a great multitasking device and a significant step up from my iphone 6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however it is not worth $1000 or more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the $100 added on by best buy is ridiculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i’m not looking forward to changing to andoid, but apple and bb are making that decision easier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
price is making apple products just a status symbol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i refused to buy an iphone plus as they are just too large and impractical for me but i felt i was missing out on some of their great features then yay!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the iphone x came along with it’s dual cameras and full screen viewing in a manageable size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are a few quirks to work out and i would love to see them make it compatible with the apple pencil but other than that, i couldn’t be happier!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the iphone x is a great upgrade to the iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the increased use of space for the screen makes the screen looks beautiful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the facial recognition works flawlessly, and the phone is the perfect size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade from a lower model phone, especially because the 8 is not much different from the 7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the device performs just fine like any of my other iphones owned in the past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there’s not major changes in term of technology, (nothing really extraordinary) the body has been enhanced and as result of that it is heavier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’m still recommend any apple device over the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best and easiest phone i’ve owned ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that facial recognition is convenient and reliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is outstanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apps install and removed easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got one for my wife also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sleek and so pretty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good sound quality on speakers,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love everything about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"smaller profile, bigger (beautiful) screen and fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
got it with zagg screen protector and the apple black silicone case - total perfection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you apple and bestbuy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unbelievably perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can’t imagine a better combo - like working with silk...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"best phone ever, very easy to use and the volume works unlike my 7plus",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the screen display seems to be sharper than my iphone7, overall speed using ios11.2.5 seems to be faster than the iphone7 for mundane tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting used to not having a home button takes a bit of time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let's see how the phone turns out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought the phone outright instead of relying on a lease program with money back from a particular carrier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just like my iphone7 that i purchased at best buy, getting the quad band iphonex is the way to go for maximum flexibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought i would miss the home button but now i never want one again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is super fast, sexy, and as with everything apple, reliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from a 6s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no issues so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the screen and the convenience of facial recognition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ten is a very nice phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does a lot of really cool stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
graphics are very good but i thought would be better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not convinced that the price was justified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cameras take great photos!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s a lot faster than previous iphones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s smaller than the 8 plus in size but the screen is larger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the wireless charging feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got the 256gb for the extra storage!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i purchased the iphone x even though i heard reviews of it not being worth the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love that is is less bulky but you have a larger screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fits into wristlets where my ipone 6 plus did not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the face recognition is one of my favorite features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don’t miss the button!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was a slight learning curve but i love it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve been waiting for this time!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i finally got the iphone x!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a great product!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’ll change your life!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve been using this phone for a little over 2 weeks now and finally feel ready to review it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first, if you’re familiar with iphones you will have to go through a learning curve to get used to the changes in how you’ll need to use gestures to do what you’ve been used to doing before now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
don’t worry though...you adjust quicker than you can imagine and will find yourself “forgetting” how to do things the old way when you pick up an older iphone afterwards lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
losing the home button is not as traumatic as some seem to think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
face id is fast and has been pretty spot on for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coming from a plus model will take some time to adjust to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will feel like the phone is significantly smaller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you’re right to a certain degree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the extra body you’re used to with the top and bottom bezels make you feel like you’re downsizing but you have to remember that the x screen is bigger (technically) so you’re mainly just loosing the extra none usable space (other than the home button since that was absolutely usable).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the x screen is longer but slightly less wide the plus models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as apps slowly start to update and utilize the full screen your experience gets better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
until then some people will complain and want to bail on the x after just a little handling time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ultimately you’ll have to handle it and see what your patience level is to see if this phone will work for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the notch...its heavily debated and will bug some people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, it’s something you have to gauge for yourself because what bothers you may not bother me (i don’t mind the notch or the size for example).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is great as always.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some features are more gimmicky than others (animoji for example is entertaining but not something i’ll likely use much) but as with every phone on the planet some things are just fun perks that may or may not be used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the glass...has some people extremely nervous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the answer for that is pretty simple...invest in a case if you’re concerned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally almost always use a case so it doesn’t bother me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn’t have a case for the better part of the past 2 weeks, dropped my phone a couple of times, but didn’t experience any cracks or anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i’m generally careful with my devices so i’ve never experienced a crack (knock on wood).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would suggest investing in applecare or insurance if you’re worried about repairs though because the cost is more expensive than ever (check the apple website for info).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, that’s a judgement call.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s not a requirement but if you know you tend to be rough on your devices and don’t want to have to pay expensive repair fees you would benefit from getting applecare or some other coverage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ultimately, i truly enjoy my upgrade to the x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
no issues so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the size is great to me but yes, it took some time to get used to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the gestures are super easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and face id has been more accurate than touch id for me (not that touch id was a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just had issues registering my fingerprint at least twice a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
faceid has only failed me if my eyes weren’t open or if the phone isn’t able to see my face because of where i am when it tries to scan me).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but overall i enjoy the x and think it was a perfect upgrade for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my iphone x expierence so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
preordered on oct. 27th and managed to get a gray/black 256gb iphone x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally arrives on the 6th and i don’t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so here i go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
open it up and everything looks good at first and then i use my iphone 6s light to look at the screen for any dust as i’ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before i even get started.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i schedule an appointment to talk to an apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i explain to him what i observed on my phone and he doesn’t seem to thrilled to help me out today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe because it’s a saturday and he’s at work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
during our conversation he makes a statement that i didn’t really care for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
such as... maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that’s what happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it’s under the screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i get two options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
option a) send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would i want a brand new item i just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
option b) go to the apple store and have them look at it and i can try and request a new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh and the next available time i can get an appointment is 4 days away and i’ll have to take off work early to resolve an apple manufacturing defect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i guess we will see how my apple store experience goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve had an apple phone going back to the 3gs days and i’ve dealt with apple customer service in the past with no issues but so far i’d have to say i’m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the iphone x and the customer service expierence with apple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully all is redeemed on the 14th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be continued...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have been using this phone since the release date, i have to say it’s way better than my previous iphone 6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new oled display is way better than former lcd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
faceid and new camera is a huge upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but apple still put 5v charger in the box which is really weird, you have to pay another $75 to get fast charge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use my ipad charger to charge and the speed is not bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall, the phone is great and i think it’s a better experience than using plus size phone even you can save $200 for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want to keep using a phone longer than two years, i will definitely recommend iphone x. i will not recommend wireless charger or fast charger(ipad charger is good enough), they are low cost accessories and evidently taking advantage of new features of the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am glad that i upgraded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it works as great as i expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love my iphone x!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is just a crazy step up from the previous phone i had (iphone 5s).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is amazing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are so many features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my favorite thing is the new anamojis!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had an iphone6 and was due for an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was a little weird not having a home button, but the face id function is awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i unlock a lot of my apps with that function and it saves so much time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it’s fast, sleek and classy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the technology hands down is way better than my 6+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love that best buy has 2 in stock!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one else did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the device is great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is smaller than the 7 plus but you don’t lose screen size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the new feature!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve always had an iphone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this one will be my last one for a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there’s been small changes to the phone that i’m still getting used to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for example swiping up to get out of a program.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had an iphone 6 then tried iphone 8 plus which was significantly larger (too large for me).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x is just the right size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen clarity is fantastic as well as processing speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don’t really use animated emoji feature that much as not supported by non-iphone users.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem adjusting to lack of home button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x worth the extra $100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i never brought an iphone by pre ordering it and used to wonder why people are crazy about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after getting apple x i know the reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new face recognition is a very nice feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don’t need to type key code just look at the screen and swipe it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery life is good with wireless charging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the portrait picture feature is also awesome.happy to have a latest apple phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wasn’t sure i would like it but the facial recognition works better than i ever thought it would and the picture quality is great and the screen is beautiful!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to me it is worth the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as always apple makes a great product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a little pricier than i would have liked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after switching from my iphone 7 plus to the iphone x and using it for three months, i wanted to share my thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pros:
- the display is the stand out star.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the home screen looks beautiful and the oled display brings the display so much closer to your face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"- speed - as with all new generations, the iphone is fast and everything loads as quick as it ever has.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
- front facing camera is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
snapchat users will like that it can detect face(s) and apply the filters much easier compared to the other iphones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- physical size - this is what sold me on the iphone x instead of the iphone 8 plus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it feels very much like the iphone 8 in size and holding it is really great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"-wireless charging - at first, this wasn't really something i considered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did pick up a charger off amazon to try and now it's the only way i charge it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's easy to set it down and forget it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"granted, it doesn't charge as fast, but the convenience of putting it on a pad makes up for this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cons:

- display's size - it's advertised as 5.8inches but if you're coming from a plus sized iphone model, you may struggle with the screen's surface area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in this sense, it feels like the iphone 8 4.7 inch screen with a little extra real estate below the app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the notch doesn't bother me nor does the lack of the home button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after three months, i'm just a tad disappointed with the size even though i'm used to it now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
- face id - its fine but not as easy to use as touch id.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"waking up in the morning it frequently fails and if i'm laying down and want to just check the phone, it is much more difficult than touch id.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
- price - it's costly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aside from the oled screen, selfie camera and face id the phone isn't much different.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall i like the phone's display and the ease to hold it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think my experience would have been much better coming from the 4.7 inch screen models, but as a former plus user, i frequently miss the larger screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is still a 5 start phone when looked at what it offers without comparing it to it's iphone 8/8 plus editions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything apple offers you does work as advertised and it's a great device overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are some new features that take some time to get used to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the improvements are much better!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera is outstanding!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the downside... the screen maybe the same size as the 6,7 & 8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
however the keys on the keyboard are closer together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have larger hands this can be challenging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is like typing on the 5 all over again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would definitely consider the over all size if you liked the larger phone even if the screen is the same size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pros out weight the cos on this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was tine to upgrade my iphone 6s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it came down to a decision between the 8s plus and the x models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wanted two lenses for photographic versatility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the x fit my hand the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don’t regret my decision!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this phone is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new display has beautiful quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the upgraded camera and portrait mode are a nice touch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
surprised how long the battery last.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the screen is noticeably larger and better, and so is the camera!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but as far as speed goes, the iphone 6s is every bit as fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great features, perfect size and best iphone to date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s camera is amazing and makes every picture look stunning!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven’t come across any issues yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from iphone 6+,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love my new iphone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it was pricey, but it’s much better than my iphone 6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far everything works flawlessly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i especially like the face id.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s easier to set up than fingerprint id and it works flawlessly every time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no more fumbling because of wet or dirty fingers and having to type in my passcode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is an issue for me since i work in industrial manufacturing and use my phone at work a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is awesome as is the display.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the phone is well built, and is quite speedy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the faceid works way better than i could have ever imagined it would.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the home button being gone isn’t an issue at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be sure you put it in a case to be safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as soon as apple gets the software tightened up this thing is going to take over the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phone has a great intro to help you learn how to use the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen is large and almost better than having a huge iphone plus!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long lasting battery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would definitely recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth every penny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new change of not having a home button is amazing and makes switching between apps easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am always changing phones, and am never happy, until now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best phone i have ever had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is my favorite!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the size and how amazing the pictures look.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasnt sure at first it would be worth the upgrade but i cant say anything bad about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is beautifully designed and i dont miss the home button at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera quality is great and the off white color looks awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from samsung note edge to iphone x. i was impressed it was the right decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the screen and the face recognition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
takes way better pictures than my old samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’m totally happy and i definitely recommend getting it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s a beautiful phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don’t miss the home button one bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve only had this phone for a few days but i already am in love with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they sound like feature works really well, much better than i thought it would.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it took me a little getting used to on where everything is changed such as there’s no home button, notification center has changed, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall though i am thoroughly enjoying the face unlock feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of the ar features are a lot of fun using me clips app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the screen also is quite stellar looking, much better than my iphone 8+ screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
have been an apple product fan for a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the newest iteration of the iphone certainly doesn’t disappoint!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the size of a regular iphone 6s or 7 but the screen real estate of a plus but slightly bigger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the facial recognition is nice but my sole concern with this device is the ramifications of the ease to unlock the phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the screen is beautiful but it has an android feel about it with the ios look, feel and security.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do not recommend if you’re upgrading from a 7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i came off of a 6s plus and would be apprehensive to say you should upgrade from that generation, but, with that being said i do not have any regrets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the price for this phone is borderline rediculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you’ll have to decide if price justifies the means.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still in awe of my new x after 2 weeks of use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life is incomparable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
camera is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
couldn’t be happier with my purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
find something new everyday that i love about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good phone, there are a few quirks and bugs to it lately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wish it had a bigger screen, but runs smooth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing really stands out beyond the screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the display is more vivid than past iphone's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i go back and forth between this phone and my pixel 2 xl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
completely different world using faceid there are times it fails but overall works flawlessly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it’s a fast phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and best buy is the best place to get it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the samsung galaxy s8 is a very good-looking phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it operates well so i have no complaints about its operation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however, i see some shortcomings in its design a prospective buyer should consider.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, these are not very serious complaints but they are, nonetheless annoyances i hadn’t considered when i bought the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the curved edges of the display work poorly with the tempered glass protectors i’ve used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rather than gluing the entire tempered screen protector to the phone’s screen, the screen protector has its glue applied only to its perimeter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this means that moisture can get between the protector and the screen and the glue-line is visible when looking at the screen’s edge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this also makes the phone is less responsive to touch in some areas of the screen because of the inconsistent air gap between the screen and protector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"furthermore, the screen isn’t protected as well at the curved edges because a protective case must allow you to see the side of the screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
this lack of edge protection allowed a short drop to shatter the phone’s screen when the very edge hit the ground.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the lack of a home key makes determining which end of the phone is up more difficult.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you can see the camera and speaker are at the top but it takes more than a casual glance at the phone to figure things out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i regret trading in my galaxy s6 and getting the s8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my main issue with the phone is 1) verizon bloat and 2) more sluggish than the note 8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the note 8 is perfectly smooth, while the s8 shows a bit of lag here and there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the verizon bloatware is terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please lookup dt ignite if you have any verizon phone and look up how to disable it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will thank me later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the positive side, the phone has a great camera, is a perfect size for people who like phones that aren't huge, is waterproof, and will be updated to oreo early february (verizon specific push might lag a bit).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had it since black friday and i have not had any issues with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
holds a charge all day (even with heavy usage) and re-charges in about an hour and a half!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very fast, takes excellent pictures, and has a ton of space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
very excited to have it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love this phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great that 64 gigs ram is standard.. battery seems to be lasting all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my old phone was a samsung s4 so it;s been a while since i upgraded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i loved my old phone but this phone is much improved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the camera takes great pictures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very clear and crisp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took while to get accustomed to all of the upgrades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is different!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy with my purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not very excited about the ""edge"" feature, but otherwise love my phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s8 is a great phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery life last all day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has great camera.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my new phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
