"during that time, the iphone has used two different connectors:
- 2007-2012: 30-pin connector (large digital/analog connector, in use on apple devices since 2003)
- 2012-present: lightning connector (small digital connector with flexible on reassignment for various protocols)

during the same period android devices have used two primary connectors:
- 2008-present: micro usb, early implementations often required additional ports for functionality like video output
- 2015-present: usb c , multi purpose port, similar in implementation to lightning
- 2008-2010: possibly some other proprietary connectors, as far as i could find, micro usb wasn't officially standardized among android device manufacturers until [2010](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_external_power_supply?wprov=sfti1)

"pros:
- gorgeous display ( seriously you will fall in love with this bezeless beauty)
- so many helpful and useful features that i never knew i wanted/needed
- insane battery life
- unlimited customization options
- more storage than you'll ever need, plus sd slot in case you somehow need more
- the list goes on and on
cons: (small things but worth noting)
- dedicated ""bixby"" button is annoying if accidentally pressed
- slick (can be fixed with skin or case)
- fingerprint sensor is in kind of a weird spot (especially for left-handed users)
